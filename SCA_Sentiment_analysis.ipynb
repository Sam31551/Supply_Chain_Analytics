            "Super good, don't get me wrong. But I came for the caramel and brownies, not the sweet cream. The packaging made it seem like brownies were packed and bountiful *crying frowny emoji* I'd say the taste of this was amazing, but the ratio of brownie to sweet cream was disappointing. Liked it regardless but probably won't buy again simply because it didn't live up to its promising package. I'll find another one that has a better ratio and wayyy more yummy chewy brownies.\n",
            "Overall, good flavor, texture, idea, and brownies. Not so great caramel/sweet cream/ brownie RATIO. Just add more brownies. Please.\n",
            "I decided to try it out although I’m not a huge caramel fan, and the first buy was ok, didn’t like the caramel too much and for some reason that specific pint barely had any brownies! Like there were some on top but from the middle to the bottom? Zilch. Nada. Nothing! It was disappointing. But for some reason, I bought it again and I really do believe it was just that point bcuz the second one was glorious!! I had a big brownie chunk in EVERY bite. Plus the caramel didn’t bother me as much and I took a liking to it. Conclusion: I’m on my fifth pint, of the week and I’m going back to get my daily pint cus I’m kinda sick and need some happiness.\n",
            "My caramel core begins to disappear about half way through. I only buy this for the caramel core. The first time I purchased this I was not even aware that there were blonde bits in there. You had me a salted caramel core, well this is the fourth pint that I have purchased and the caramel is plentiful at the top then it begins to get sparse about half way down at 3/4s of the way down its gone. It works out in my husbands favor because he doesn't care for the caramel so he gets to finish my pint while having a full pint of his choice. Please please please, its called salted caramel core for a reason. Let the caramel flow through the core. P.S. You could put a little extra in there, I totally would not mind.\n",
            "Why are people complaining about the blonde brownies? If you don’t like blonde brownies, get ice cream with fudge brownies! I LOVE the blonde brownies and cannot get enough of them. This ice cream is by far my favorite. I have driven to multiple stores to try and find it... and when I do, I stock up! I’ve tried other flavors when I can’t find this one, and none of them even come close to making me as happy as this does! I’d say sometimes the caramel to brownie ratio is a little off at times (more brownies please!), but I’ll still always enjoy it nevertheless!\n",
            "This ice cream is worst ice cream I’ve ever tasted. I was beyond excited when I picked it up today and couldn’t wait to get home and try it. First the sweet cream ice cream has no flavour. But that’s fine I could get past that, but the salted caramel core is what’s really wrong. It’s disgusting and so salty it’s actually inedible. I’ve had ice cream before that I have really enjoyed but never to the point where I physically can not stomach it. I love salted caramel but this is just another level. I actually came here to read the reviews and see how others thought of it just in case mine was a bad batch. Never again!\n",
            "I bought this last night to go with Louisiana Crunch cake because I was craving that salty and sweet flavor. Unfortunately, I was not thrilled with the salted caramel core of this ice cream. Usually, when you have salted caramel, the salt enhances the flavor of the caramel. The salt in this core OVERWHELMED everything, even the cake. It was disappointing to not enjoy my dessert and I doubt I'll be finishing this pint of ice cream, which is a shame because you should never have to throw away ice cream.\n",
            "This is definitely my favorite flavor, but recently, it does not have enough blonde brownie chunks. I'll go through at least half of the pint with just 1 or 2 chunks. It looks like plain ice cream with a salted caramel core. This has happened a lot lately, and it's so dissapointing. I've gotten to the point where I simply stopped buying it. Today, purchased two because they were on sale. It started the way it should be, with plenty of yummy chunks. Before I even got halfway as I was serving myself, no more chunks. After some digging around, I found 3 more way at the bottom. Please fix this! I love this ice cream, but it's pointless without the chunks.\n",
            "I am not a chocolate person at all, and this was my very first time trying Ben & Jerry's, (Shame on me I'm 23 lol) so I was so excited to find a Caramel Ice Cream with BLONDE Brownie chunks instead of fudge. I really wanted to like this ice cream but I just couldn't. The Salted Caramel is a little too salty, In fact, I couldn't even eat the core, I just ate around it. I didn't really like the Sweet Cream Ice Cream, it didn't really have a taste to me, (Maybe Vanilla would be better). The only thing I loved about this Ice Cream were the Blonde Brownie Chunks, They were so delicious! I would love for this Ice Cream Recipe to be worked on, maybe I'll give it a try again in the future.\n",
            "I LOVE caramel, so much so that I could eat it off a spoon, which was exactly what I was planning to do when I bought this ice cream. Unfortunately this caramel core is way too salty. I actually eat around it! I'm not a fan of the sweet cream ice cream flavor either; vanilla would've worked better. The blondie pieces were delicious but overall I'm disappointed. I really wanted to love this since I love Ben & Jerry's but this was not up to par with their other flavors!\n",
            "I love all the Ben & Jerry’s flavor. But recently I been so disappointed of my favorite flavor salted core caramel. It has no core\n",
            "The ice cream really didn’t taste like anything significant and then the caramel which carried the whole dessert ended half way through the cup :( very disappointed!\n",
            "The core was absolutely delicious for about a scoop of icecream. Then there was no core for the entire rest of the pint. Huge disappointment.\n",
            "I've seen this flavor multiple times at the grocery store the past few months and been tempted, finally pulled the trigger last week.\n",
            "I feel like a dork writing a review for ice cream, but usually a pint only lasts us 3-5 days in our home and we were so disappointed with this one and it's still in the freezer a month later untouched. In addition, I love anything caramel but the salted caramel core was so overbearing, I honestly don't know how this made it on to be a final flavor after the taste testers tried it. It's just too salty. We scooped the caramel into the sink, but then the rest was just a little boring. I will still be a loyal B&J fan, but will be super hesitant when it comes to their caramel line.\n"

            "This flavor was automatically bumped into my top three fave Ben & Jerry flavors. The ice cream really tastes like a chocolate malt milk shake! The marshmallow and truffles only amp up the experience. You must try this flavor!\n",
            "My favorite is boom chocolata. Although it's tough to pick a favorite. \"Chocolate shake it\" is right up there. Amazing flavors, texture, and just the right amount of marshmallow and truffles. Very impressed with this one.\n",
            "The Walmarts in my area stopped carrying this flavor for some reason and now I have to find a replacement, since this one has become my go-to flavor. BUT I cannot eat any other ice cream anymore none live up to this stuff.\n",
            "For me this is just a perfectly balanced ice cream. It's not too sweet and a great mix of flavors. I love it so much I came to write this review. I'm pregnant with my second child now and I crave this flavor all the same!\n",
            "This is ther best flavor & icecream I have EVER had! EVER! I loved everything about this mixture. I need this in a gallon. Marshmallows, chocolate truffles & more yummy stuff. It has a slight chocolate malt taste too.\n",
            "Please make this more available! Found it once in our little corner store, but now that’s out and I haven’t seen it in Ralph’s nor Vons. Usually I don’t like chocolate ice cream, but this malt version is perfect!\n",
            "I am not even a huge chocolate fan but I saw the malted milkshake part and I wasn’t sold.. very nice flavor.. the truffles are soft and tasty and you can taste the milkshake! I would definitely purchase again!\n",
            "I bought 2 since it sounds delicious, and it is...except the truffles which are unfortunately terrible. But the malt chocolate ice cream and marshmallow is awesome so you can just eat around the icky bits :)\n",
            "I would buy out the stock at any store I could find it in because I loved this flavor so much! It even replaced my Half Baked addiction. Now I can barely find it and I am so sad. Please bring it back!!\n",
            "This is good, especially the malt milk chocolate and marshmallow swirls. But it was soooo much better with the chocolate truffles instead of sea salt caramel. Please go back to the non-caramel version!\n",
            "This ice cream changed my life and I can NEVER find it anymore. It tastes just like a classic malt when Dairy Queen and Sonic just don’t get it right. The marshmallow swirl makes it phenomenal as well.\n",
            "Admittedly, I'm not usually a fan of chocolate ice cream, but this was milky enough, and I loved it. My kids loved it too, and ever since we had our first pint, we've been trying to get another one.\n",
            "Bought this on sale because it looked yummy, and it's absolutely amazing! I don't buy a lot of ice cream, but I would definitively get this in the future and keep an eye out if I go to a B&J store.\n",
            "I decided to try something new. Bad idea. This is very bland and the truffles taste odd. I didn’t taste any malt flavor, and the chocolate was weak. Im glad it was on sale so I only wasted 3.50.\n",
            "Please keep this flavor. I was so upset when you guys only did a limited batch of Cannoli. Such a tease. While Chocotherapy was my favorite since Cannoli...now this one tops all of them by far\n",
            "I just bought this for the first time ever and it’s so good!!!!! It takes like a genuine chocolate milkshake. The marshmallow is amazing and the truffles are divine. My new go to.\n",
            "Ignore the haters. If you love malt chocolate you’ll love this. Mine was smooth and creamy with tons of chunks of truffles and loads of marshmallow. Malt chocolate magic!\n",
            "3.1 balls. Its just ok. Lots of better flavors out there. Its somehting to try, and if its the only flavor id eat it happily. But nothing special.\n",
            "My dad bought me this and I loved it. It's my favorite ice cream in the whole entire world! Thank you for this AMAZING ice cream flavor!\n",
            "Love a great chocolate shake but this was too sweet, not sure what it was...not enough chocolate flavor. Might have tried adding malt.\n",
            "I looked for this flavor all over....finally found it. The marshmallow swirl is so creamy and satisfying. The truffles are amazing.\n",
            "This variety holds its own against some of my all-time favorites such as Phish Food & Americone Dream. I buy it anytime I see it!\n",
            "This is the best ice cream! I love the truffles and marshmallow swirl, and how the ice cream tastes like a milkshake. Delicious!\n",
            "The most amazing flavor ever. I feel like I am eating a thick milk shake. I wish It was available more. I can never find it.\n",
            "I tried this flavor and loved it! Just enough chocolatey goodness paired with creamy heaven! Definitely will try again.\n",
            "This is the best ice cream since Friendly’s Toasted Almond Fudge or Ben & Jerry’s White Russian or Pistachio Pistachio\n",
            "This is the one pint I need to make sure I don't demolish in one sitting. All restraint melts away with my happiness.\n",
            "Good concept, but skip the malt. Leave it chocolate ice cream like phish food and keep other ingredients. Yum overall\n",
            "I love everything malted.. I was hoping for more of a malted flavor but still love this ice cream and will buy again\n",
            "Can’t find this in the Minneapolis area anymore. Not sure if life is worth the trouble, please stock the shelves!\n",
            "If you like “phish food” this is so much like it just with a creamier texture. This is my new favorite!!\n",
            "I was at the plant last weekend and thought I would give this a try! Really hit the spot. LOVED IT!!!\n",
            "I tried this when it came out.. I am officially hooked! Its creamy, chocolatey, truffly goodness.\n",
            "This is our new family favorite! It’s really hard to find so I hope it becomes more popular.\n",
            "Very good! One of my favorites definitely recommends it for anyone who hasn't tried it.\n",
            "great chocolate malted ice cream with a sweet swirl of marshmallow!! Great new flavor.\n",
            "I was hooked from the first bite. I love chocolate malts, and this one blew me away.\n",
            "Super smooth chocolate ice cream. All around amazing flavor. I love the truffles\n",
            "Bought for my neice ...and it was delicious! Only problem ` cant buy it locally\n",
            "It was good besides all the fudge. Other than that the ice cream was very good\n",

            "This may be my favorite ice cream ever!!!! I love the subtle malt flavor.\n",
            "they need to bring back a hazelnut ice cream because this is not good.\n",
            "Tried this for the first time a couple of weeks ago. I’m hooked!\n",
            "It’s good, but I liked the truffles better than the fudge pieces!\n",
            "Best flavor I've ever tried. I think it is perfection!\n",
            "Got this as one of my cones for my halfy birthday! Great for chocolate lovers! Very rich. Cookies add a nice crunch.\n",
            "This is the flavor that won my heart by Ben and Jerry's. If you are some one who loves chocolate and/or chocolate ice cream then you need to try this because this one does not disappoint. You will want to be multiple pints because one pint just won't be enough. I could easily eat pints and pints of this deliciousness in a single day and I am not exaggerating. It really is the best chocolate ice cream I have ever had. They could have aptly named this one Brownie Batter because it really tastes like frozen a brownie. This is for all of us chocoholics out there. Thank you, Ben and Jerry's and please never discontinue this flavor! You have shown the rest that you are the best when you created this flavor.\n",
            "Oh my god! If you love chocolate this is your ice cream and if you need a chocolate fix, this is your ice cream and if you’re not sure if you love chocolate this will be the ice cream to ensure you do! Up there with Chocolate Fudge Brownie and phish food, this is a new favorite of mine. So silly good I could eat 2 or 3 pints in one sitting. Please do not retire this one anytime soon and if you do, please give us lovers of the flavor some time to stock up.\n",
            "I just recently bought this at My local publix and wanted to try something new and picked this up. Very dense chocolatey icecream. Tastes like real chocolate compared to other ice creams but my problem with this is it should've had actual chocolate pudding swirls instead of pudding icecream and the cookies instead taste more like chocolate chips instead of cookies. The icecream also is more of a dark chocolate flavor, slightly bitter. Would've tasted much better if it was chocolate fudge icecream or Milk chocolate icecream but still a good icecream I just wouldn't buy it again\n",
            "I tasted this ice cream for the first time last month. Since then, I've been hooked! It has all of my favorites into one. I love chocolate chocolate chip cookies, chocolate pudding and chocolate ice cream. Please, never change this recipe or discontinue it, because it's the only therapy I need! :)\n",
            "This ice cream is exactly what it's title implies - therapy through chocolate, only way cheaper than therapy. The chocolate pudding is amazing and it is so delish you really only need a few bites to hit to spot. My favorite chocolate ice cream of all time!\n",
            "I really love Ben and jerrys chocolate ice cream. It's the only chocolate ice cream that tastes like chocolate. I was excited when this came out so I could mix it up a bit and give my tastebuds a chance to miss chocolate fudge brownie. I really like this one but I think the cookies weren't the right choice. I like the pudding ice cream so I think what would've been better would be like a ganache swirl or chocolate frosting. Chocolate cookies aren't very popular to begin with so it wasn't the selling point for me. I wanted to try the chocolate pudding ice cream. Still though it's a rich chocolate ice cream that I enjoy a lot\n",
            "I tried this for the first time a few months ago and it is perfect when you need a chocolate fix to make you happy:) It is so creamy then you get the chocolate cookie swirl. I shouldn't admit it but I have at least once a week.\n",
            "Seriously the best chocolate ice cream I've ever had.\n",
            "Wow wow wow! I have found, along with a handful of others, another favorite! Amazing! This IS THE quintessential chocolate ice cream for chocolate lovers. The pudding and cookie swirls: totally out of this world chocolate flavor. My phish food and chocolate fudge brownie have competition! If you love chocolate, buy this pint. It won’t disappoint! Sorry for all the exclamation points but I’m serious, you need to be eating this.\n",
            "Finally, a chocolate ice cream that is decadent, dark, and not too sweet. The pudding ice cream is an excellent touch and I love that the ice cream is not too milky. The chocolate cookies are a nice touch, although unnecessary to my enjoyment of the experience of eating this wonderful ice cream! Thank you for making a flavor for those of us who believe the only \"real\" and \"tasty\" kind of chocolate is dark chocolate!!\n",
            "The level of chocolate this product will bring you is mind and body saturating.\n",
            "If you need love and you are lonely or female and suffering 'that time' just put yourself in the bliss of this ice cream. The pudding ice cream is spiritual. You might need to eat this ice cream away from others, where they cannot see how it makes you feel. You may not be ready for how it makes you feel.\n",
            "I bought this on a whim because I was craving Chocolate Ice Cream. It's now been 1 1/2 months and my husband and I have eaten no other ice cream except Chocolate Therapy. We hope they never stop making this flavor.\n",
            "Smooth, rich without being overwhelming, great pudding texture and flavor and wonderful little fudge pieces.\n",
            "It doesn't get any better.\n",
            "Also, it's the absolute perfect pint of ice cream for when you have your period, or you're just grumpy and watching movies.\n",
            "So rich in chocolate and has texture throughout the entire pint with loaded chocolate cookies! I get at least a pint every week! Short and simple ingredient list and pretty great nutritionally for all that you get. Thanks Ben & Jerry's!!\n",
            "My hubby brought this home for me from Albertson's. I probably wouldn't have picked this flavor myself. I usually go for chocolate with lots of stuff in it, nuts, caramel, whatever! It looks simple but the flavor is bold. It tastes like real chocolate, rich and flavorful. Better than any other chocolate ice cream I've had! My teenage daughter agreed, it is delicious!\n",
            "I eat this every night. I calculate calories throughout my day to allow for my Chocolate Therapy.... every. single. night. They laugh at me when I check out at the grocery store - I buy all they have in stock. The intensely dark chocolate, coupled with the cookies and pudding are the perfect way to end the day...every. single. day.\n",
            "When I saw the name I instantly grabbed it because I was in need of some chocolate therapy. I couldn't have been more satisfied and have purchased 3 pints of the stuff over the past few weeks. This will indulge all of your deepest chocolate cravings and leave you a bit depressed when you know there's none left in the freezer. it has all the right notes of milk chocolate and dark chocolate and then there's texture of smooth and creamy, pieces of chocolate cookie and/or brownie, and the silky texture of frozen pudding. This is a winner and I hope they never discontinue it.\n",
            "This is THE flavor I never knew I was missing. My new favorite. PLEASE don’t ever retire this!\n",
            "I don't usually like chocolate, but on the few emotional times when I crave it I want real chocolate which I've never seen in an ice cream before. This ice cream is heaven! Chocolate so rich you would think it was gourmet. The only thing that could make this better is to make it even darker.\n",
            "My teenaged son: \"Mom, what's that?\"\n",
            "Me: \"Chocolate therapy ice cream... my favorite.\"\n",
            "Son: \"Can I try it?\"\n",
            "Me: \"Sure, but save me some.\"\n",
            "Later, my son walks into the kitchen with a spoon and the empty pint in his hand. \"Sorry, Mom. It was just too good to stop.\"\n",
            "And it is.\n",
            "I was craving chocolate ice cream and I decided to stop by Ben & Jerry's. The young lady was sweet to offer samples and I chose Chocolate Therapy. I'm so glad I did. It's really rich but I ate the entire scoop. I've only had Ben & Jerry's once.\n",
            "This was a special treat.\n",
            "A very satisfying chocolate ice cream combination! But I haven't been able to find it in the grocery stores near me. What is happening? They're still being made right?\n",
            "It's my dessert after every dinner. It's in my grocery shopping cart every week, usually 2 pints. The chocolate is amazing. Love it.\n",
            "The Pudding swirls really help with the flavor, This is my favorite Ben And Jerry flavor.\n",
            "It's the best store bought chocolate ice cream. I only let myself have it once a month (wink) & it's become a tradition lol Most times I will get ruffle potato chips, let the ice cream melt & dip the chips in it. Freaking yum.\n",
            "This is the ultimate adventure in chocolate, can not buy any other flavor since trying this. Ben and jerry should win the Nobel peace price for ice cream for this flavor. Guess there is a heaven, I visit it during every bite.\n",
            "Excellent flavor. The only chocolate ice cream's that I Eat are Ben & Jerry's. The ice cream itself is similar to phish food, but the other ingredients are very different. And delicious!. I love the cookies !\n",
            "Are you a chocoholic? If the answer is yes then what are you wating for to try this ice cream? And if you're not then I swear you will become one after trying that, it's addicting. Soooo good\n",
            "A friend bought this flavor for me on my birthday two years ago. I haven't stopped eating it since. Please keep making this flavor or I may have to go to therapy for separation anxiety.\n",
            "I tried this as a whim in the grocery store and found my chocolate heaven. The name fits. I hope the keep this flavor. I loved candy pie, but this is WAY better!!\n",
            "I have enjoyed this flavor since it came out.\n",
            "It hasn't disappointed in cheering me up when I'm feeling down.\n",
            "It truly is delicious, well done B&J\n",
            "This is by far the best ice cream I've ever had, so much chocolate deliciousness in one container. Thank you thank you thank you\n",
            "My fav flavor so far but I have loved Ben and Jerrys since I went to college at Purdue University in West Lafayette IN !!!!!\n",
            "If you love chocolate, you'll love this flavor. Very one-dimensional, but that's a good thing when it comes to chocolate.\n",
            "perfect balance of rich chocolate and little cookie pieces. The texture is amazing!\n",
            "I'm a chocoholic and this is the perfect ice cream. Rich and smooth.\n",
            "Omg best chocolate chocolate ice cream ever ever ever\n",
            "Best flavor to ever fall into earth and into my mouth\n",
            "It's harder to find but when i do find Chocolate therapy I buy a couple. Not all stores sell this flavor. By far, my absolute favourite!\n",
            "Bought on vacation. Love this flavor! Super smooth.\n",
            "If you like dark chocolate, you'll like this flavor, but if you're like me and really taste the bitterness in dark chocolate, you won't be crazy for this one. Wish the website would indicate which chocolate flavor are dark chocolate and which are lighter/milk chocolate (if any are).\n",
            "Best chocolate ice cream I ever had! The taste, the texture, just perfect!\n",
            "I was expecting chocolate paradise, big chewy chunks of chocolate cookie dough, obvious pudding swirls and thick creamy ice cream.\n",
            "I am a chocoholic! I started my Ben & Jerry’s journey with Chocolate Fudge Brownie. It was okay but I didn’t like the chunks of brownie. The texture wasn’t right. Then, I found Chocolate Therapy and I fell in love! I relocated and now I can’t find it. My husband seems to think it may be discontinued. Please say it’s not so!\n",
            "I'm not even a huge chocolate fan but this ice cream flavor absolutely caters to my cravings when I am actually craving something with chocolate. It's the best chocolate ice cream, the pudding is amazing, and oh my goodness I love the chocolate cookies. Absolutely by far my favorite ice cream flavor to exist.\n",
            "The flavor is good, but the “chocolate cookies” is more like tiny bits of cookie pieces. I ate more than half the pint before I even found a tiny morsel of a cookie. If this flavor had actual chunks of cookies, or even better brownies, this would be my new fav. The pudding swirl is delicious.\n",
            "I am a huge Ben and Jerry's fan, and I love all of their ice cream. I have not had Chocolate Therapy in a while, and I will tell you, it was a bad experiance. The ice cream did not taste the same and I was really upset. I have not tried Chocolate Therapy since.\n",
            "This is my all time favorite Ben & Jerry's ice cream!\n",
            "This is my new therapist!\n",
            "It's as if decadent chocolate could pick you up, cradle you and tell you everythings going to be alright. All the other flavors are just ice cream. This flavor has got your back. Don't ever discontinue it. Pretty please!\n",
            "...and by ridiculous, I don’t mean “deserving or inviting derision or mockery”. I mean the most ridiculously good ice cream deserved of world wide acclaim and the high honors for greatness... some sort of prize should be in order as well.\n",
            "If I had to choose only one chocolate ice cream to get my chocolate ice cream fix, it is definitely going to be this! The chocolate variety tends toward a dark flavor, which I love. This is hard core chocolate therapy indulgence.\n",
            "This ice cream does not dissappoint. The texture and flavors are perfect in every way. I rarely get cravings for chocolate but when I do this is exactly what I go for. I just wish I could find it in stores more frequently.\n",
            "Today was the first day I tried chocolate therapy and it is delicious but i would've added brownie chunks instead of chocolate cookies that taste like chocolate chip pieces but other then that its yummy delicious!!!!\n",
            "I can eat the whole pint of this flavor in one sitting. Every time it’s in stock at the store, I make my mom buy it even if we already have some at home. You can never have too much chocolate therapy.\n",
            "Chocolate Therapy has walked me back from the ledge on several occasions. Joking! It's SO good and so chocolaty (is that a word?), that I'm feel it's meant for women. :-)\n",
            "This was my all time favorite ice cream before I stopped consuming dairy and I would love to be able to eat it again! It’s exquisite. Ben and Jerry, make it happen!\n",
            "I went to my local scoop shop in 2013 and tried a scoop of the Chocolate Therapy. I've been hooked ever since. Seriously guys, I buy at least two pints a week.\n",
            "This is seriously addictive stuff. It tastes like and has the texture of chilled rich brownie batter mixed with chocolate cream. Just heaven in the mouth.\n",
            "I’m not a chocolate ice cream girl at all, but this flavor is amazing! I love how rich and creamy it is; I also love the chocolate cookie bits! So yummy!\n",
            "I don’t know why I tried this. I don’t typically like chocolate on chocolate but this was fantastic! I think the pudding was interesting and marvelous!\n",
            "All other brands of chocolate ice cream fail in comparison! This is my go to and not substitutes, unless it is another Ben and Jerry’s flavor!\n",
            "Chocolate, chocolate and chocolate. I don't usually like bits interrupting my smooth ice cream texture, but the cookies are good.\n",
            "This is one of the best flavors, in my opinion. It has a rich flavor and great texture, just the right amount of components.\n",
            "I bought this because my pregnancy cravings were demanding chocolate and boy I was not disappointed! New favorite flavor!\n",
            "This is the first Ben and Jerry's flavor I ever tried and has remained my favorite. I is perfect for chocolate lovers.\n",
            "This is THE best ben and jerrys flavor! So chocolatey, and so delicious. Perfect anytime, even my cat loves it!\n",
            "So I saw this in the store and I decided to get it. My mouth was watering as the ice cream melted in my mouth\n",
            "Favorite ice cream of all time. hands down. Thanks for this Godsend, Ben and Jerry.\n",
            "It’s so good that it should be a sin. Ugh, I can’t get enough of it!\n",
            "I love dark chocolate and this combo is amazing! Quite tasty...\n",
            "Just love the Chocolate Therapy! I like the texture and flavor\n",
            "Always satisfied when I pick up some Chocolate Therapy\n",
            "It has literally been about a decade since I've had chubby hubby. I went to the scoop shops and they said it was discontinued, this was a few years ago. Well, I begrudgingly made peace with it a while ago. There was always that small voice in my head that said to check the freezer in my grocery store (this is over about 4 different states I've lived in), alas, no dice. Tonight, I have been reunited with my best ice cream best friend, I was at Walmart picking up a few things and that little voice said \"just look for it\". So I did, and there it was. I stood there in pure amazement for a good minute. Never give up hope.\n",
            "That if something happened to this flavor of ice cream I would die inside. This has easily become an addiction and I forewarn everyone who dares try it I've been on the hunt for it at every store near me trying to get the sellers nearest me to keep it in stock instead of only Cherry Garcia which I personally a peanut butter pretzel fudge loving person am not very fond of. If this ice cream Chubby Hubby was in fact a Chubby Hubby he would definitely be my hubby of choice. So a huge thank you to those coworkers the pranki. My only complaints are where and what is up with the Froyo version! Please attend issue as soon as possible\n",
            "I just had my first pint of Chubby Hubby and I thought it was great! The ice cream flavor is delicious. Since my first experience with this flavor was after the change from peanut butter filled pretzels to regular pretzels, I can’t speak to that (though the filled ones do sound great) but the chocolate covered pretzels in the new pints are great! The reason I am giving my review 4 and not 5 stars is because I didn’t get any chocolate peanut butter swirl until the very bottom of the pint. I can imagine that if it had been dispersed throughout, it would have been AMAZING! Still, I will get another of these in the future.\n",
            "Why tinker with perfection? It appears that Ben & Jerry have changed their \"formula\" for their classic Chubby Hubby flavor, and in doing so have made it far worse. The ice cream used to be fuller and creamier, with peanut-butter filled chocolate covered pretzels and scrumptious robust chunks/gobs of peanut butter. Indeed, quite decadent! Now the ice cream is more \"watery\" (almost like skim milk), the pretzels are no longer filled with peanut butter, and the peanut butter is simply thinly swirled. The result: a pale comparison to its former self; not as rich, not as tasty. Tastes very generic now. Skimping... a sign of the times... Will not be buying again.\n",
            "I just bought this flavor for the first time in two or three years because I was so upset about the change in pretzels a few years back. While the current pretzels are better than the round ones you had for a while, they still don't compare to the yummy peanut-butter filled pretzels of yesteryear. There must be a way for you to source these?? Pretty please?\n",
            "I just tried this for the first time and was so excited to find a new ice cream with peanut butter and chocolate! I've never before found an ice cream flavor I just didn't like (and my first job was selling ice cream, so I've tried a lot!). I wanted to love it, but after a few bites, I found one of the pretzels, and it was so salty! I thought it was a fluke, but I soon found another that was worse. It took a few minutes for the salt to dissolve in my mouth. Now I LOVE a sweet/salty combination, but I would have gotten less salt licking our Michigan winter roads. I hope this was a bad batch, but I won't be taking my chances.\n",
            "This used to be my very favorite ice cream in the whole world! What's NOT to love? But not anymore. The chocolate-covered pretzel pieces are unsatisfactory. Although the pretzels do not taste stale, their consistency feels chewy and stale. They used to be peanut butter filled pretzel nuggets covered in chocolate - a crunchy triple delight! I no longer buy this ice cream. :-(\n",
            "I have a tough time finding this flavor, and thank goodness for that, because I find it impossible to put it down whenever I get it. This has been one of my favorite flavors for at least 17 years now. BTW, those gym bills keep getting sent back, marked \"return to sender\" - am I using the wrong address?\n",
            "I had this flavor for the first time a few months ago after finally tracking it down and it's AMAZING. Definitely in my top 3 right behind Cinnamon Buns and Peanut Butter World. My pint had over 15 pretzels in it and I was very happy. Only suggestion would be to make the pretzels into peanut butter filled pretzels!\n",
            "I bought this last night, and was disappointed when I bit into a giant pretzel cluster that it was half salt. Needless to say I was forced to wash my mouth out a bunch, and lost my appetite very quickly.\n",
            "I can't remember the first time I tried Chubby Hubby, but from the moment I did, it has been my hands-down favorite ice cream flavor of all time (and this is quite an honor of distinction, as I love many different brands of ice cream and their flavors!). There's just something MAGICAL about the formula of malt vanilla ice cream, with just the right amount of peanut butter and fudge swirling through, and the crunchy chocolate-covered pretzel nuggets embedded within---this combination is something close to ice cream heaven!!! Love digging into the pint, savoring the rich ice cream, and uncovering those awesome chocolate-covered pretzel nuggets---like mining for gold. Please, Ben & Jerry's, NEVER EVER discontinue this AMBROSIAL flavor!!!! And THANK YOU for providing me with such a great experience through your ice cream!!! :)))\n",
            "This is hands down my favorite ice cream on the planet. I guess I'm fortunate that I almost never find it in stores, because i can't see it without buying it. A lot of people have complained about the change from Chocolate covered peanutbutter FILLED pretzels to chocolate covered peanutbutter pretzels (it is my understanding that this was due to the original pretzels no longer being available to B&J's). While I do thing that the original was better in principal, I found that I frequently got pints where the pretzels were soggy and disappointing. I have never had that happen with the new recipe. The new pretzels are always crunch and a little bit saltier, which I actually prefer; I need the salt to balance the fudge and vanilla malt. Still the best!\n",
            "This is my new favorite flavor, tried it for the first time about 2months ago.\n",
            "Wanted to try this since it seemed like a popular classic flavor. Sorry to say it was disappointing to me. The pint I got contained mostly chewy pretzels instead of crunchy ones. It also seemed that there were peanut pieces that were chewy. I liked the crunchy but the chewiness was an odd texture.\n",
            "We just recently it found chubby hubby at Meijer yesterday and my husband got excited because it's his favorite ice cream. We just ate it and it wasn't the same. The pretzels are supposed to be filled with peanut butter, not coated. I personally couldn't taste the peanut butter at all and the pretzels were too chewy. We will probably not be biting this flavor ever again.\n",
            "this was my favorite up until the pretzels were no longer filled. it gave the ice cream that soft texture nw it has too much crunch and will never be the same. still good but not great and can never find it anywhere lately\n",
            "Bring back the old pretzels or find a new peanut butter pretzel cause these chocolate covered ones aren’t the same. Changes the ice cream completely so people don’t buy this flavor anymore\n",
            "I used to love this icecream with the nice crunchy pieces of pretzel, now the pretzels are really chewy and at times really un enjoyable, still a great ice cream though\n",
            "This has been my favorite since the beginning! Sweet and salty, smooth and crunchy! Never stop making it!\n",
            "The last time I had Chubby Hubby was when the pretzels were filled with peanut butter. I then tried it again and found no peanut butter in the pretzels. No doubt this was a change due to cost, but something was different with the overall flavor. Just not my favorite anymore. So unfortunate.\n",
            "My girlfriend and I thought this was our new favorite flavor (actually got on here to review how amazing it is) then we began reading other reviews only to realize the pretzels used to be filled with peanut butter. We now can’t stop thinking about how much better that would taste. It has ruined our night. We are the type to obsess over something like this. Will be awake for next 4 days thinking about that peanut filled pretzels. Smh. (But buy the flavor. It’s amazing)\n",
            "....the very best! Malt ice cream, peanut butter, fudge and pretzels...yowsa it's amazing! My only complaint is that it can be difficult to locate! I stock up whenever I find it though! Thanks Ben & Jerry for the most fabulous ice cream, ever!!!\n",
            "Chubby hubby is one of my favorite Ben & Jerry flavors, however the pretzels used to be stuffed with peanut butter a few years ago. It was WAY better then! I hope you consider going back the old way!\n",
            "This flavor used to be truly epic. Chocolate covered, peanut butter filled pretzels were the stuff of legends. Sadly, legends are now all they are. Bring back the real chubby hubby!! :-(\n",
            "I am truly dumbfounded as to how anyone could possibly rate this ice cream as anything less than five stars. This is the perfect food. I often go on extended diets, and they are almost bookended with a pint of Chubby Hubby. It's honestly one of the only things that keep me going in life. The crispiness and the saltiness of the pretzel, combined with the sweet and chewy peanut butter swirls. It's just incredible.\n",
            "I LOVE this flavor! Only ice cream I will buy at the store for the past 6 years now I even got my family hooked on it as well. A lot of people are mentioning the pretzels, but I love the extra crunch. There is already a peanut butter swirl and a little peanut butter goes a long way since it is a strong flavor. Thank you for making this ice cream and please please please never get rid of it.\n",
            "My husband and I have been buying this ice cream flavor for about 6 months now. We are obsessed with this flavor. Chubby Hubby ice cream is addicting. We're just disappointed it doesn't come in a bigger size than pint and the pretzels are no longer filled with pb. I love the chewy pretzels. It adds character to the ice cream!!! Thank you for this yummy delightful flavor!\n",
            "Unbelievable that they changed the pretzels that used to be chocolate covered and chocolate filled and now they are plain, dry, with something they \"call\" chocolate covering them but it's just brown lard and there are SO many of them, hardly any ice cream, of course because they are cheap compared to cream, that one cannot even scoop the ice cream because the scooper keeps kitting pretzels, like big rocks when digging in dirt.\n",
            "Ben and Jerry's is my splurging ice cream. Once a month I buy two pints. I always tell myself I'll make them last the entire month, and instead I'm ice cream-less for about 25 days until I buy more.\n",
            "My first taste of Ben&Jerry's was about twenty years ago. It was Chubby Hubby when the ice cream was peanut butter. Who had the lame brain idea to change it to vanilla malt? That ruined what was so special about it. Sadly, none of the current peanut butter offerings live up to the old Chubby Hubby.\n",
            "I was extremely disappointed with this flavor. It was almost impossible to eat because every bite was a chunk of pretzel. The little \"vanilla\" ice cream in the pint was almost sour and not the same as the regular vanilla flavor. Not to mention I didn't see a single bit of peanut butter.\n",
            "I have been eating Chubby Hubby since its inception! The name made me laugh so I tried it! What could be better than pretzels,peanut butter and chocolate!\n",
            "Please don’t ever discontinue this yummy and fun ice cream!\n",
            "After not seeing this, my favorite flavor, for years, I was really excited when I saw it in the freezer section! Malted milk vanilla ice cream, peanut butter and fudge swirls and, the best part, chocolate covered, peanut butter filled, pretzels, Oh My. Unfortunately, the new rendition of this flavor is missing the peanut butter filled part of the pretzel which makes it just a dry chunk of pretzel covered in a thin layer of chocolate. It's OK but now where near as good as the original.\n",
            "This ice cream used to have more of an intense malt flavor--now the flavor of malt is lacking. The base of the ice cream used to be more like marbled fudge with thick swirls of peanut butter--now the base of the ice cream is vanilla with thin swirls of peanut butter and fudge. The pretzels used to be filled with peanut butter and covered with thick chocolate to keep the pretzels from losing texture--now the pretzels are not filled with peanut butter and the chocolate coating is not thick enough to prevent the pretzels from becoming soggy. I'm assuming the company did this to trim calories but if people want to be on a diet, we wouldn't be buying premium ice cream. Although this flavor is still good, it does not have the perfection it used to have years ago. Please go back to the original!!!\n",
            "I love this flavor so much and I am so mad because I CANT find it at any store. I have looked in 3 different states (I move a lot) and none of them sell it anymore!!!!!!!\n",
            "Bring the old pretzels back. Used to be my addiction and would woof down the whole thing in one setting. I know that the old pretzels sometimes got soggy but when they did not, the whole thing tated sublime. Now, the pretzels are huge lumps, crunchy but fairly tasteless and not stuffed with peanut butter. Plus, I almost always get one or two super super salty (as if I crunched a lump of salt) pretzels that ruin the whole experience. Do something to fix and save this amazing flavor!\n",
            "We have a hard time finding grocery stores in our area that carry this flavor. Currently there is only one that we're aware of, so that's where we choose to shop!\n",
            "Perfect mix of sweet and salty this s a must. The chocolate covered peanut butter pretzels are just what makes this a perfect combo.You will not be disappointed.\n",
            "I love this. I got addicted to Chubby hubby when I was pregnant with my son. It is like moosetracks ice cream but better. Sweet and salty, a perfect choice.\n",
            "this is the best peanut butter and chocolate ice cream there is to date. PLUS, theres PRETZELS CHUNKS. What more could you ask for? more of it, perhaps..\n",
            "A bit of sweet, a bit of salty, a bit of crunchy... ohh my. To bad I am having a hard time finding it in stores around me.\n",
            "Just not sweet\n",
            "By far the best flavor in the World. Can’t beat sweet, salty, creamy and crunchy. Hard to find, an emerging top ten.\n",
            "When did you resurrect this flavor? More than 20 years ago i fell in love with Chubby Hubby. Extraordinaire taste!!\n",
            "It is my ultimate favorite flavor!!! Its the only grocery item I wont share with my household\n",
            "Agreed. It's not as good as it used to be, but. Peanut butter pretzels that is all.\n",
            "I have loved this flavor for years. Please NEVER discontinue it!\n",
            "All time favorite B&J flavor!!! All time favorite B&J flavor!!!\n",
            "So, I spent a few months trying to explore as many Ben&Jerry's flavors as I could, but I've come to the conclusion that this is my favorite ice cream flavor EVER! I grew up drinking vanilla malt milkshakes with my dad and this ice cream base is perfectly that. I love the fudge swirls, they have a very classic chocolate syrup taste. They're not too overpowering! Always so many pretzels too! This ice cream is a no brainer for me. Team Chubby Hubby 5ever. <3\n",
            "Grew up loving this ice cream. Rarely would get anything else. Was disappointed in The change from chocolate cover peanut butter FILLED pretzels to simply chocolate covered but was able to look the other way as the peanut butter swirl still meet my needs. Once they changed those pretzels to way over loaded salty pretzels is been really disappointing. Thought maybe I was crazy but finally came to the website to see I am not the only one who feels this way.\n",
            "Chubby Hubby was the stuff of my childhood dreams and has been my favorite flavor ever since tasting my first scoop many years ago (more than I care to admit or try and number). I will not even be in the mood for ice cream, and yet I still check to see if it's in stock, any time I pass an ice cream selection in any store ever. Simply the best! If you haven't tried it yet, you are missing out. But that's fine, because it leaves me more pints.\n",
            "I kept hearing about the hype around this one and had to try it for myself, I was not let down. The pretzels were by far the BIGGEST chunks in a Ben & Jerry's ice cream I have tried thus far, combine that with a little peanut butter and it is just pure heaven!\n",
            "This is hands-down the greatest ice cream ever created! I have a deep love for this ice cream and last year during a PRIDE event, Ben & Jerry's had a stand where a worker informed me that they are going to change the name to \"Hubby Hubby\", having two cows with top hats on.\n",
            "My blonde bomber of a cairn terrier -- Earth Dogge Mulligan -- and I used to eat CH after our pizza. It is the BEST. ICE CREAM. EVER!!! My boy is now enjoying pizza and CH on the Rainbow Bridge. And I get CH on my birthday. The smile on his furry little face as he plowed through his very own bowl always pops into my head on that day. Thanks for the memories.\n",
            "I've been a Chubby Hubby fan for many years. I now live in Singapore though, where I've never seen it in shops. Last year I was in Hawaii and was delighted to find Chubby Hubby readily available there. I certainly took advantage of that availability while I was there, but I'm back in Singapore now, with no Chubby Hubby. Please make it available in Singapore!\n",
            "The ice cream is one of the few malt flavors and if that’s not enough to be incredible, the salty and sweet of the chocolate with the pretzels just make it amazing. The pretzels aren’t soggy since the chocolate makes a perfect shell, and there’s the perfect ratio of chunky to ice cream itself. I really hope this one sticks around forever because it ROCKS.\n",
            "This used to be my absolute favorite flavor. How I miss the chocolate covered peanut butter filled pretzels of the original, classic, version of Chubby Hubby! Never mess with a great. Every time I think I will give it another try, I am dissapointed because I still remember how truly great flavor originally was and miss that this version falls short.\n",
            "This I've cream is by far my husbands very favorite ice cream. Our only problem is that we have had to go vegan for our health and can no longer consistently dairy or eggs. Would you please consider making a non dairy vegan version of this with the crunchy peanut butter pretzels please! We have had 2 of the vegan flavors and they were great!\n",
            "This is the best icecream on the planet, even with the new chocolaty covered pretzels. But I still dont get why you dont want to bring the peanut butter covered pretzels back ?!! Most of chubby hubby fans are asking you and complaining but you just ignore. I dont understand what's so hard about getting the old recipe back.\n",
            "I just tried this flavor for the first time and I thought it was delicious! The chocolate covered pretzels were nice and crunchy! The saltiness of the pretzels was great with the sweet ice cream! The malt flavor of the ice cream was also great along side the huge swirls and fudge and peanut butter!\n",
            "This ice cream flavor is the best. The malted vanilla is already delicious on its own, and yet it melds so wonderfully with the peanut butter and fudge swirls. The stars of the show, though, are the pretzel pieces - crunchy, sweet, and salty perfection. Absolute joy in a pint!\n",
            "This is my favorite flavor but I’ve noticed over the last couple of years it’s tasted much sweeter. It’s missing the over the top peanut butter that I fell in love with. It used to have a better balance of sweet and salty. It’s still great but I wish it hadn’t changed. ❤️\n",
            "This was my favorite flavor of Ben & Jerry's ice cream. The ice cream doesn't even taste the same as the original. The chocolate covered pretzels are too big and aren't filled with peanut butter anymore. Why, oh why did you change a great flavor?\n",
            "Chubby Hubby is the best flavour ice cream I’ve ever tasted. All the elements blend so well together to create the ultimate taste sensation. It’s been a good few years since I’ve been able to taste it though as it sadly no longer is available in the UK!\n",
            "This flavor is addictive. I hope Ben and Jerry will never stop making it. Although the recipe changed recently (the chocolate covered pretzels are no longer peanut butter filled), I still love it with all my heart. Thank you for making Chubby Hubby!\n",
            "I happened upon Chubby Hubby ice cream at my neighborhood CVS. I had a hankering for some Ben & Jerry’s (my absolute favorite brand), and decided to open up the CVS ice cream vault of awesomeness. Low and behold I saw the funniest name I had ever see labeled on an ice cream, “Chubby Hubby”. I laughed, read the description and the story behind it, and thought that I had to buy this even if it wouldn’t fall into my “favorites” category .\n",
            "I was wrong in so many ways! I fell in love with this ice cream! The peanut butter and the chocolate covered pretzels...... my mouth is watering right now as we speak! Ha ha ha!\n",
            "My husband, family, and friends all know that if they want to put a smile on my face, simply buy this ice cream for me. In fact, the hubbs has replaced flowers with Chubby Hubby ice cream and it may have saved our marriage multiple times (I also may be a tad dramatic).\n",
            "I believe they should rename this “Chubby Wifey” because I’m pretty sure I will get that way if I keep eating this at the rate I am.\n",
            "#putdownthespooncharity\n",
            "I don´t alway find this Chubby Hubby in the stores but when I do I make sure to grab a couple.\n",
            "It´s my absolute favorite. I just love the Fudge-Covered Pretzel bites, gives a little salty crunch to the sweet and peanut buttery ice cream.\n",
            "I’ve been eating this flavor of Ben and Jerry’s for over 20 years. It’s been revamped with different pretzels but it still tasted exactly the same. They used to be peanut butter filled pretzels which was awesome. Chubby Hubby for the win!\n",
            "My favorite flavor so far. Yum yum.\n",
            "Now if you could make a flavor of just good vanilla ice cream with lots of peanut butter swirls. (Either crunchy or creamy). Have waited for years for someone to make this and nothing so far.\n",
            "I'm giving this a 5 star because it sounds so amazing, though I've never had it. I drove around tonight on a mission for over an hour following the flavor tracker and failed miserably. I'll find you one day chubby hubby!\n",
            "Just the right amount of texture, sweet, salt, chocolate, and peanut butter! Gobs of those delightful pretzels. Can't go wrong with this pint! Sometimes a little tricky to find, but not impossible. The perfect ice cream.\n",
            "I went to a Ben and Jerry’s store out of state that had this and it was the best ice cream I’ve ever had! Unfortunately there isn’t any store that sales this flavor... :( I’d buy this every week if I could!\n",
            "The best flavor there is! I've tasted a bunch of other flavors but I always keep going back to this one. The sweet and salty of the pretzel and the combination of chocolate and peanut butter are the best!\n",
            "I love this icecream please do not ever stop making it. If there is a contest to enter to win a lifetime supply please let me know. PRO TIP: mix with oat of this swirrled flavor for a cinnamon explosion!\n",
            "Words do Chubby Hubby no justice! My all time fave for sure and always on the look for it cuz its sometimes hard to find. Cheers to Ben & Jerrys for this timeless classic !!! Keep up the great work!\n",
            "One of my favorite ice creams. It is a great blend of salty and sweet, with the sweet ice cream base and the crunchy salty pretzels. The only bummer is not many stores in my area or IL carry it.\n",
            "This is by far the very best ice cream i have ever tasted. The combination alone is completely genius. Thank you for creating this peanut buttery, malt fudge filled masterpiece.\n",
            "This is by far the best flavor of all time. So sad it isn’t sold any more. Every other flavor I get I want it to taste like this and they all fall short.\n",
            "I have been trying to remember the name of my favorite ice cream in the entire world .. chubby hubby... .. absolutely amazing!!! Thanks Ben and Jerry\n",
            "This is the best ice cream ever. I've been eating it by the pint for what seems like forever. Don't change it and definitely don't stop making it.\n",
            "Salty and sweet perfection! Who wouldn’t like peanut butter, chocolate and salted pretzels? I’m always sad when I can’t find it at the store.\n",
            "this is by far my favorite ice cream from ben and jerry’s if not my favorite ice cream period! i hope they never discontinue this flavor!!!\n",
            "It would get 5 stars but i didnt like the huge pretzel bits. I expected broken up pieces of \"tiny twist\" pretzels. They were so salty too\n",
            "Chubby hubby was my first b&js ice cream, I’ve tried many other but it will ALWAYS be my go to and my favorite I’ve cream of all time\n",
            "This isn’t by far the BEST GD FLAVOR y’all have ever made it isn’t hands down my favorite and a bust have after a rough day lol.\n",
            "This is my favorite flavor of Ben & Jerry's. The closest store to me that sells it is 22 miles away and it's worth the drive.\n",
            "This is my Go To for ice cream. It has everything I need to satisfy cravings. Sweet creamy crunchy salty dream come true.\n",
            "The pretzels in this ice cream are good, but if you can’t handle that much peanut butter, than this might be intense.\n",
            "I bought this a couple weeks ago, and I can’t stop thinking about it. Each time I get it, it gets better and better.\n",
            "This used to be my all time favorite but lately all the pretzel pieces are either too salty or soggy. Disappointed.\n",
            "I was pretty amazed to find out there were no pretzels in my pint. Great flavor but extremely disappointing.\n",
            "It is so good! The flavors mesh perfectly together and it's salty and sweet. The pretzels are the best part.\n",
            "Breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks.... I just can't put it down.....This is gonna make me a real chubby hubby\n",
            "Ate the whole pint last night. Perfect balance of chunks and ice cream. If you love peanut butter get this.\n",
            "The best flavor, ever!! Everytime I see this flavor I can’t help but buy it. My wife gets mad at me. Lol\n",
            "Best flavor hands down! Chocolate covered pretzels filled with peanut butter, what more could you want?\n",
            "I LOVE this ice cream. Its a a bunch of my favorites toppings in there. Great ice cream. great choice.\n",
            "My favorite flavor. Could eat the point myself no problem, the sweet and salty mix PERFECTION!\n",
            "ALL pretzels were in the bottom and the ice cream seemed as though it had melted t some point\n",
            "I eat a pint every night! I eat ice cream for dinner. It has all the major food groups right?\n",
            "Has been my favorite for 20 years. Think it needs to be carried in every Ben and Jerry store.\n",
            "The 1st time I tried this flavor I was hooked! It is hard to put down once I start eating it!\n",
            "What kind of pretzels do you use?\n",
            "They are so good I need them to munch on!!\n",
            "hella good. like yum. the flavors just explode. great mix of sweet and salty\n",
            "Loved this flavor and all of the chunks that are added to the ice cream\n",
            "Perfect when you really want ice cream and something salty and sweet.\n",
            "This is perfection in its tastiest form. It needs to be 5 stars.\n",
            "I love it but can NEVER find it!!!! Please bring it closer to me\n",
            "This is my favorite ice cream...Where can I buy this flavor at.\n",
            "This is probably my most favorite ice cream flavor of all time.\n",
            "So incredibly salty that it was inedible. Who thinks that’s ok?\n",
            "All you need to know. Last name greatest!!! First name ever!!!\n",
            "Has become one of my favorites! Perfect mix of sweet & salty\n",
            "It takes a Chubby Hubby to know the best Chubby Hubby!\n",
            "FAVORITE FLAVOR of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream ever!!\n",
            "So hard to find, but still my favorite from day 1!\n",
            "My first bite of B&J YEARSSSS ago, have turn back!\n",
            "Chubby Hubby has been a favorite of mine for decades. It seemed to completely disappear from shelves for quite a few years but recently I've started running across it again in stores and am delighted.\n",
            "I was sad to give a mediocre rating because I really loved the flavor of this ice cream. I have never had banana ice cream before and B&J does it perfectly. The addition of walnuts and chocolate pieces makes this flavor simple but delicious. Maybe it was an isolated incident, but my pint had very few chocolate pieces. I think I was averaging 1 chocolate piece for every 4 scoops of ice cream. That's not great, especially since the image on the label shows it being riddled with chocolate. I am hoping this was an isolated incident and the next chunky monkey pint will be better.\n",
            "If I didn't know any better I would've thought this flavor was made with love and some type of witchcraft- it's that good! ❤️\n",
            "This is my favorite ice cream ever! I buy it by the pint and in a Chunky Monkey waffle cone whenever I can find a B&J store.\n",
            "I was shocked to find only banana ice cream, not one walnut or piece of chocolate.\n",
            "I bought this at my local grocery store. I almost always buy Cherry Garcia but they were out. My next go to, plain ol' vanilla was not available either. I decided to try something new, normally I'm not adventurous with my food. I decided on trying Chunky Monkey because I love bananas. I opened my pint a few nights later, took my first spoon full and there were no chocolate chunks and very little walnuts. I kept digging and nada. The ice cream was very tasty and smooth. The walnuts had a nice nutty toasted flavor. Still, no chocolate chunks. It wasn't until I got to the bottom of the pint a few nights later did I find THREE chocolate chunks. Not cool, not cool at all.\n",
            "I tried this flavor for the first time a few months ago, and albeit I'm not much of an ice cream person as it is, I CANNOT stop buying myself a pint each week! It is SO SO good. The banana base is perfection! I honestly don't even need the walnuts and the chocolate, although the walnuts are absolutely amazing in it... They completely NAILED the banana ice cream. Just....wow. <3\n",
            "Tried this flavor today I was unsure about the bannna flavor but got it anyway it is so good. Bananas flavor was perfect wasn't overpowering the chocolate pieces were good tastes like good quality chocloate. I will get again\n",
            "Being a lover of ice cream, bananas, chocolate, and all forms of nuts, I expected to like this ice cream much more than I did. After the first few bites into the pint, I realized how gross the banana flavor in it is. This might just be me, but I did not like the flavor. Eating into it some more, I noticed a stinging in the back of my throat, I think because of the fudge pieces. It was an acidic sting the more I ate, and the worse it got the more I ate, so I ended up throwing away the pint soon after I started.\n",
            "Delicious, creamy nana icecream with nice chunks of chocolate and walnuts.\n",
            "I've been eating this since I was a kid, its their best flavor!\n",
            "This is the first I have tried chunky monkey. My go to is Americone Dream. I love chocolate covered bananas so I thought ... why not? I am so disappointed. Halfway through my pint and have only found 3 chocolate chunks. The ones I did find were delicious!\n",
            "Got this instead of the mint to switch things up and let me tell you, I LOVE THIS. Great banana flavor. Everytime I take a bite with the fudge chunks it tastes like a chocolate covered banana\n",
            "Okay I absolutely love this ice cream, it is my favorite Ben and Jerry's flavor in fact. It's hard to choose the best part, but it is the chocolate chunks. After an intense amount of research I was unable to find what kind of chocolate was used in the ice cream. I would pay a lot of money to eat a chocolate bar made out of the kind of chocolate used in chunky monkey. So, as far as I'm concerned if you would like to keep my business you have two choices: 1. Add much more chocolate to pint of ice cream like advertised or 2. make chocolate bars. Thanks and have a great day.\n",
            "I've been a Chunky Monkey fan for over 15 years now. I moved from New Jersey to Alabama to find out the quality is not the same. I've notice less chocolate chunks and the ice cream has a gritty texture. Not sure why the disparities but I look forward to going home (Jersey) for Christmas. I have a suggestion, PLEASE consider selling in half gallon or gallon sizes. This would make my life complete. Thank You for a delicious product\n",
            "My brother introduced me to this flavor years ago and it remains my favorite!\n",
            "I am addicted! this is the best product ever. The only one I purchase. I do not care about the calories because I run them but this icecream is so worth it. I used to make my banana shake with oats and milk...I gave that up to have this. My local grocery store was out so I decided to try the \"Almond Milk\" and I can tell you I was disappointed. The texture was not the same...it tasted like regular chunky monkey but expired.\n",
            "I absolutely love this Ice cream but I 100% could go without the walnuts, I don't really like those in there, I feel like the walnuts should be replaces with a lot more chocolate chunks. Breyers used to sell a banana ice cream with chocolate chips when I was younger but discontinued it and I was so unhappy! But this one is great, but again, a lot less walnuts or removing them completely would be great.\n",
            "My absolute favorite. My favorite thing to do is share some with my little man who loves it as well!\n",
            "This is the best thing you could ever purchase, a very good investment.\n",
            "I could gain 100lbs on this ice cream and be happy.\n",
            "I have been buying Chunk Monkey for years, I open it up and next thing I know.... I ate the whole darn thing!\n",
            "My biggest disappointment is I can't get it anymore.\n",
            "I moved from Montreal Que, to Saint John NB and there isn't a single store anywhere I can find it. My freezer used to have a pile of steak and a pile of Chunky Monkey.\n",
            "First Ice cream flavor I had ever tried.. and wow. All I can say is this is nothing compared to any other Ice cream companys Ive tried throughout my childhood years till now. All though I can say is I do wish It had a great price where other buyers are able to afford it such as myself. But overall, I think this flavored Ice cream should be one of your GREAT classics.\n",
            "This is honestly my top favorite flavor ever but I wish the chocolate and nut chunks were smaller... when chocolate freezes it gets even harder to chew and it hurts my teeth so I usually eat around the bigger pieces and just eat the smaller ones!\n",
            "Love this flavor, rarely is banana done right. Only reason it’s not 5 stars is that I feel as though the walnut and chocolate pieces should be smaller so that the ice cream is more easily consumed when it is really cold.\n",
            "The banana flavor is soooo good but I literally got 2 chocolate pieces which was kind of disappointing. Maybe I'll give it another chance.\n",
            "Every time I go grocery shopping I buy 5 pints (which I go every week because I’m a college student) I wish I could buy more but I’m a broke college student. I go thru a pint every night. One day I walked to family dollar up the street because I thought they had it but they didn’t. After leaving family dollar I walked to multiple corner stores and they didn’t have it and they weren’t close either I was so depressed and sad when I went back to my dorm room. But I eat this ice cream almost every week. I just wanna say if you guys ever have a contest for a giveaway for this specific ice cream for months or a year I am entering and ima do everything to win! Love this ice cream out of all the Ben & Jerry ones ive had. I’ve even made my family start eating this one and one of my family members don’t even like bananas. Lol\n",
            "I am a chocoholic and will almost never buy any ice cream with any fruit associated with it but I decided to be open minded with this and give it a shot, so trust me when I say that this stuff is absolutely amazing. I was afraid that it was going to have a very strong banana flavor but it doesnt at all. It doesnt taste like a frozen banana or a banana smoothie or the artificial banana you see in popiscles and candy. Instead, the masterminds created a perfect harmony of sweet cream, vanilla, and banana that keeps it from being boring and the texture is out of this world, better than any soft serve i have ever had with it's creaminess and density. The only reason i am not giving this a 5 stars review is because i didnt care for the walnuts or the fudge chunks. They could have left them out completely and that would have been perfectly okay with me or have gone with milk chocolate chunks or peanut butter cups. Still, this ice cream is one of their best and one of the best i have ever had and i am shocked to say that about a fruit flavored ice cream. I was so impressed with the flavor that went out the next day to buy another pint. Now I know why it's a top seller year after year.\n",
            "The best combinations could only ask for smaller chocolate chunks\n",
            "Try this flavor! You'll return to the store for more!\n",
            "Love Chunky Monkey but can we get a banana ice cream with York peppermint patties worked in?? Now that's a coooool monkey.\n",
            "Incredible real banana flavor, dark chocolate chunks at the size you DREAM all chunks should be at, and fatty walnuts to die for. So many other ice creams are sugar OVERLOADS. This flavor does not have to rely of excessive sugar to be great. Chunky Monkey is the umami of ice creams. Change my mind. Also, BRING IT BACK. My local stores are falling short. -Richmond, CA 94805.\n",
            "This has been my favorite ice cream since I first tried it when I was a teenager. I keep saying I’m going to try another flavor, but it’s so hard. I love Ben & Jerry’s. There is no other ice cream that can compare to their ice cream. I mean every bite there is goodness! And anyone who knows me knows that I am not sharing my “Chunky Monkey”\n",
            "I'd normally be skeptical of nuts in ice cream, but the walnuts and chocolate chunks in this flavor are just what the absolutely delicious banana ice cream calls for. I would like to shake the hand of whoever concocted this amazing recipe. The banana ice cream tastes delicious and unique, and the nuts and chocolate compliment it perfectly.\n",
            "The ice cream gods smile upon the flavor gurus that crafted this heavenly concoction. I always played it safe with cookie dough and half baked until I gave this flavor a try, and ever since, I'VE BEEN HOOKED! Forever my favorite, I urge EVERYONE who likes banana walnut to try this flavor, you won't be sorry!\n",
            "I loved the banana ice cream, it didn’t have that artificial banana flavor. Combined with the walnuts reminded me of banana bread. I didn’t care for the chocolate chunks, I wish there was a fudge swirl instead. I wish there was another banana flavor combined with peanut butter, caramel, or cheesecake.\n",
            "I bought Chunky Monkey a couple\n",
            "Of days ago and baaabbbby.... let me tell you, this is the BEST ice cream flavor I have ever tasted. I love Coldstone’s banana ice cream but it has nothing on Ben & Jerry’s Chunky Monkey!!! It is perfection! Perfect flavor and perfect chunks! A new staple in my house!\n",
            "The banana ice cream is overpowering and struggles to compliment the chocolate and nuts. I ate a quarter of it and threw the rest away.\n",
            "I purchased this ice cream because I'm lactose intolerant and was tired of only purchasing Breyers basic vanilla lactose free flavor. This ice cream is so good even my 2 yr old enjoys eating it. I just wish it was sold in a half gallon. The pint isn't enough.\n",
            "I just tried this flavor and it's delicious!! The ice cream tastes exactly like frozen bananas with no after taste. The nuts and chocolate pieces are definitely a plus. I always loved Ben & Jerry ice cream and this will be one of my new favorites!\n",
            "I bought two Ben and Jerry's Chunky Monkey one pint ice cream. When I got home, I found out they must have been refrozen many times. The taste was horrible...what a disappointment. I could not recommend this product the way it was to anyone.\n",
            "This is my favorite. Just needs to change one thing, and this applies to all their flavors with chocolate chunks. DON’T. Jus leave out the chocolate chunks. They get hard as bricks when frozen and have no flavor. Like eating bits of plastic.\n",
            "Chunky Monkey is by far my favorite ice cream and trust me I have eaten plenty of brands and flavors! BUT two of the last 3 pints I purchased were very disappointing. VERY VERY FEW fudge chunks - my favorite part of the pint!\n",
            "I am hocked, I was on dialysis, for about 5 years, I couldn’t eat ice cream, I just got a transplant in April, 2020, I have been eating this ice cream like crazy. But I was wondering if you could make it in your yogurt recipe.\n",
            "I love your pint size Chunky Monkey... it is my guilty pleasure. Can you make it in the 4 oz size? I have only seen Cherry Garcia and Cookie Dough ice cream in the 4oz. Thank you! Also I would appreciate any coupons!\n",
            "I now do my own at home, leading to the realization that roasted macadamia nuts make a better-than-BJs Chunky Monkey. Drop the walnuts, sub in macadamias and I think you'll have the best banana ice cream on the planet\n",
            "Great ice cream but I hardly got any walnuts in my pint. Lots of fudge chunks but little to no walnuts. This is already a simple ice cream and walnuts are one of only two mix ins. And there was hardly any in pint.\n",
            "I’m on a mission to try all the Ben & Jerry’s flavors and have landed to Chunky Monkey. I can’t believe I held out so long! I thought banana ice cream would suck, but leave it to Ben and Jerry to prove me wrong!\n",
            "I absolutely love Chunky Monkey. It’s always nutty, not too many chocolate chunks, but not to few. It’s always perfect!\n",
            "Just finished my pint of Chunky Monkey and it was sooo good. There was a perfect ratio of chocolate pieces and walnut to the banana ice cream in my tub. By far my favorite flavor of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream.\n",
            "I love this ice cream! Banana ice cream has to be my favorite now. The fudge chunks are awesome (!) rather than having some swirl, and the walnuts are a perfect additional compliment. 5 Stars; 2 thumbs up!\n",
            "I’m not sure how you do it but you get the perfect balance of chocolate, walnuts and banana flavor in each bite! No searching for chunks around the pint, they always there with each spoonful.\n",
            "Seriously, who thinks of banana ice cream with walnuts!? It's so good it should be illegal. But please don't make it illegal, I prefer not to have to go through the Black Market to get this.\n",
            "I never get tired of this....it’s my all time favorite!! Bananas and walnuts are so perfect together...throw some chocolate in and I’m the happiest human on the planet!! Love it!❤️\n",
            "Brought this the other night, had it before and loved it! However, we dig around and only found a coulple of chocolate chunks, it was so good last time we were left disappointed:(\n",
            "Everything about this ice cream is perfect. The banana flavor is light, refreshing, and doesn't taste artificial. Perfect amount of chocolate and walnuts. Absolutely delicious,\n",
            "I tried this at one of the Ben and Jerry's factories in Vermont and I loved it. I have bought it so many times since then and it is my all time favorite ice cream flavor ever!\n",
            "Banana “flavor” is the worst. This reminds me of homemade banana ice cream. For me the nuts and chocolate are an added bonus but not the main event. It makes me happy.\n",
            "This is my favourite! An ultimate flavour combo that works every time. The fruitiness, the nuttiness & the chocolate rich taste comes together Harmoniously.\n",
            "This flavor never fails to lift my spirits! The chocolate chunks are a perfect amount so that the banana flavor of the ice cream isn't overwhelmed. Love!\n",
            "We love the sweet simplicity of the trio of flavors! Sweet banana flavored ice cream, chunky dark chocolate pieces and rich walnuts .....it’s a hit!!!\n",
            "Every time I’m at the store I have to pick a pint up. Can’t say enough about it. Smooth banana ice cream with decadent chunks of chocolate and nuts!\n",
            "I love banana ice cream, walnut, and fudge. But there is no fudge, it is dark chocolate which tastes like burnt chocolate to me. Will not buy again.\n",
            "Flavor of the ice cream is nice and banana-y and there are some walnuts, but where are the chocolate chunks? Because of that, it is disappointing.\n",
            "So sad they changed this magical flavor. It’s now sickly sweet and you can’t really appreciate the flavor combo because all you taste is sugar.\n",
            "By far, the one flavor everyone knows is Ben & Jerry's. Chunky Monkey makes life fun, no matter how old you are. Banana Ice Cream is the star.\n",
            "The last 3 pints i bought of Chunky Monkey seemed to be lacking on the banana flavoring. Somewhat bland.\n",
            "Have they changed the formula.\n",
            "Chunky monkey is so addicting. The banana, walnut, and chocolate flavors go together fabulously. No doubt my favorite ice cream flavor.\n",
            "This flavor is very good and unique but it lacks more toppings. I want more walnuts and chocolate chips and then it would be perfect!\n",
            "I've never tasted an ice cream better than the chunky monkey. I can eat the whole pint at once. It's just impossible to stop eating\n",
            "What the title says!! I've never met a better ice cream flavor. The banana is perfectly sweet and the walnuts perfectly walnutty.\n",
            "This is the best banana ice cream on the market. I love the chocolate chunks and the walnuts. Thank you so much for making this.\n",
            "This flavor combination was one I used to go for almost all the time. It has a really banana flavor if you really LOVE Bananas.\n",
            "Literally one walnut and a couple of chocolate bits. The rest was the overperwering banana. Love B&J's but this was a joke\n",
            "I love the variety of flavors within a Chunky Monkey pint. It's excellent for making sundaes and banana splits! Yummy!\n",
            "I literally buy this Everytime I buy ice cream. I wish the chocolate pieces were smaller, however I keep buying it lol\n",
            "Best banana flavored anything! Normally I don’t care for things that are banana but this is my favorite flavor lately\n",
            "In my top3 my favorites, taste so pure and fresh, which is weird cause who would of thought frozen would taste fresh.\n",
            "It’s been my favorite for years. Banana ice cream check , chocolate chunks check and walnut pieces check. Sooo good\n",
            "I've been purchasing Ben and Jerry's chunky monkey for over 20 years. Awesome flavor, texture,\n",
            "Chunky Monkey is not only my favorite flavour of Ben&Jerry's, but it's also the best I've eaten in my life\n",
            "Good flavor but feel like it needs cherries added to it. Its definitely missing an additional ingredient\n",
            "It will be a sad day when TR4 wipes out bananas for good. Get some Chunky Monkey while you still can!\n",
            "I wish this flavor was available in gallon sizes because I buy a pint or two almost every other day.\n",
            "literally my favorite ice cream ever... I'm lactose intolerant but I suffer for some Chunk Money\n",
            "Hooked ever since I tried it. Family loves Ben and Jerry. We each have our own favorite flavor.\n",
            "If I had to complain about this ice cream, it would be that it doesn't come in gallon sizes.\n",
            "I love Chunky Monkey, sweet ice cream which chucks of chocolate and walnuts, its too good.\n",
            "This flavor is the reason I eat Ben and Jerry's! My absolute favorite ice cream ever !!\n",
            "Literally the best ice cream flavor I have ever had. In fact its the only one i eat!\n",
            "Not too many added in pieces. The banana flavor isn’t overbearing. I love it.\n",

            "Has been my favorite flavor since I first tried it. Absolutely amazing.\n",
            "Would love for there to be a little more walnuts. Too much chocolate.\n",

            "Please keep this flavor. It's one of my favorites.\n",
            "30 years. 3 continents. 7 countries. Countless types and flavors of ice cream. This is it. This is literally the best ice cream flavor I have ever tasted in my whole life, period.\n",
            "I am in love with this flavor. It's a little hard to find but whenever i see it, i seriously by 3 pints at a time. (and its gone by the end of the week because my kids love it too)\n",
            "This is my favorite Ben & Jerry’s flavor ever, I’ve been getting it for years and since I’m lactose intolerant I even tried the dairy free version and it was amazing too! My biggest complaint is it’s impossible to find in my area! So sad!!\n",
            "This is one of the best ice cream flavors I have ever had. It is probably more like top 3 flaovr for me and I have tried a lot of ice cream. It is bursting with cinnamon flavor and is unlike any flavor I have ever had. I got my Mom hooked on it now. If there is EVER even a thought of retiring this flavor I would have to make a trip to Vermont to talk to the CEO of Ben and Jerrys. It is that good.\n",
            "This flavor is the best ice cream flavor I've ever had. It's my favorite. Please bring it back to my area.\n",
            "I bought this the other day, skeptical it'd live up to all that cinnamon-y goodness. I know that the salt caramel core ice cream needs more caramel, so I was iffy about this.\n",
            "My #1 favorite & I have access to ice cream, fresh frozen custard, frozen yogurt, etc. I can't even come up with words to describe the deliciousness of this caramel ice cream with cinnamon bun pieces & the cinnamon strudel swirls!!!!! This can NEVER end up in the graveyard! Thank you for this flavor.\n",
            "Eating it for the first time right now, you guys are gonna make me into an addict with this flavor!\n",
            "This is the best ice cream I have ever tasted. I have never written a review but this merits one!\n",
            "I (embarrassingly) spent about half an hour reading Ben and Jerry flavor reviews before deciding that Cinnamon Buns was going to be my new favorite! Drove to the store and could hardly wait to taste it when i got home and....... I was disappointed :( Although the cinnamon flavor was delicious and definitely there, the cinnamon bun dough pieces that other reviewers were raving about just weren't there for me. The dough was VERY dry and crumbly, NOT at all soft and gooey like others have claimed. Not sure if mine was a bad batch but unfortunately I was very disappointed.\n",
            "Hello, my name is Ronny I just want to say how absolutely amazing Ben and Jerry’s did on this one of a kind flavor. When I taste this ice cream. I taste morning breakfast at grandmas with a cinnamon bun in my mouth melting my tastebuds. Ben and jerry all I can say is you succeeded everything and beyond. Thank you for being you and all you do to make these flavors. You always have my support. Never again will I have another brand of ice cream outside of Ben and Jerry’s. Thank you. I love you. Goodnight\n",
            "I purchased this flavor after reading how great it was on reddit.\n",
            "I can honestly say I’m very disappointed.The cinnamon bun dough are like gobs of gritty sugar. The caramel ice cream is ok. Almost like eating liquified brown sugar pop tarts.\n",
            "I’ll stick with cherry Garcia\n",
            "All I can say about this one is that it’s perfect! The ice cream is great, the bun dough chunks are perfect and the streusel swirl is SUBLIME! I let mine melt for just a few minutes to get it even gooier! This is a great flavor pint and was just a little sad when I finished it.\n",
            "Cinnamon Buns was the best ice cream coping mechanism to help me with my dad passing away in August 2018. It's fulfilled my love for cinnamon and is my favorite flavor in the world! As of March 2019, however...I never see it in my area. My college town and my hometown don't seem to sell it ANYWHERE! I actually cried on my mom's birthday over it, how embarrassing. It truly is the best ice cream in the entire world. I miss it so much.\n",
            "The first time I tried this was a few months ago and man, have I been missing out!! This stuff is heaven in a little pint.. I'm kind of glad these are sold in smaller amounts sometimes.. because its so addicting you almost want to eat the whole thing in one sitting!! I try to make it last but its so difficult! Lol <3\n",
            "Please do NOT ever think of discontinuing this flavor... 'cuz its the bees knees! Haha! :)\n",
            "I ran to the store to try a new flavor and just opened a pint of this today and was disappointed in the quality of the buns dough... the dough tasted old and was too hard. I tried leaving it to sit out for a while to see if it had just needed to thaw a bit, but that did not do the trick, also there were big almost sugar cubes between the ice cream. :(\n",
            "Look no further, Cinnamon fanatics. This is the flavor you've been waiting for. The gooey swirl will keep you diving back in with your spoon, and if you're lucky you'll come up with some cinnamon bun dough too. I've considered buying an extra freezer dedicated to pints of this flavor. I can only hope it sticks around!\n",
            "Finally decided to try this flavor today and my goodness I was NOT disappointed. That streusel swirl is heaven! And the dough pieces remind me more like giant frozen pieces of crumb topping. Like the kind on top coffee cake with is HEAVEN. I definitely need some warm coffee cake to plop a scoop of this deliciousness on!\n",
            "I just tried this flavor for the first time and it's my new favorite flavor. It's everything I hoped it would be - from the ice cream itself to the cinnamon swirls, streusel pieces and cookie dough. Absolutely delicious. If you love the rich, indulgent gooeyness of a fresh cinnamon roll you'll love this flavor.\n",
            "I was super excited to stumble upon this flavor. It was delicious other than the cinnamon bun dough bites. The dough had a weird taste and after a few pieces i could only describe it as a black licorice flavor. I mostly picked out the dough pieces and was able to enjoy the rest of the ice cream!\n",
            "I have to admit that I was a little skeptical about this when I bought it, so I bought a backup pint of Americone Dream just in case. I have never eaten a pint of B&Js so fast in my life.....it was amazing !!!!! Keep it coming B&Js.....Cinnamon Buns has officially entered my top 5\n",
            "Love, love, love this flavor!! It used to be harder to find, but lucky me it started showing up in more places. This is by far my most favorite ice cream flavor. I never get tired of it and when I do try other flavors although I enjoy them I always go back to my cinnamon buns!!\n",
            "There is nothing I love better than a cinnabon bun. However, for me, this did not translate well into ice cream. Maybe i'm getting older, but this flavor is over the top sweet for me. And that is saying a lot. Sorry, I won't be buying this one again.\n",
            "As a chocoholic, it's a pretty big deal when I will always choose this ice cream flavor over any chocolate flavor. Please don't ever retire this flavor! I could not live with out my cinnamon buns ice cream!!!\n",
            "I actually came here to figure out if Cinnamon Buns is just a seasonal flavor. Why is it so hard for all of us to find (I've now read everyone else's comments). Please deliver more everywhere!!!\n",
            "This is by far my favorite ice cream. I'm not always a big ice cream person but I always end up eating the whole pint of this stuff. Tastes just like a cinnamon roll!\n",
            "LOVE the cinnamon bun dough chunks and the delicious creamy cinnamon flavor. It’s really like a cinnamon bun in ice cream form!\n",
            "If you love brown sugar pop tarts then you will love this! Its the exact flavor plus so much more!\n",
            "I've never thought that an ice cream would make me feel all warm and gooey and content inside but Ben & Jerry's decided otherwise. I bought this on a whim when my cinnamon loving mother was supposed to visit me but I ended up having to buy a second pint before she even got there. This ice cream has such a pronounced buttery cinnamon flavour to its base, and the dough remains just soft enough so that it really feels like you're biting into a chunk of the thick cinnamon rolls you get at the mall. The cinnamon streusel swirl was probably my favourite part though. My mom and I fought over who got to scoop their spoon through the biggest swirls. Just to note it, my first pint had a lot of swirl while my second had more dough. Both were delightful but I wish it would have been more consistent with more of both aspects please!\n",
            "My favorite flavor ever!!! Is different from all the other companies\n",
            "Broooooo. it SLAPS. It is for sure my new favorite.\n",
            "This is my absolute favorite flavor of any ice cream! It might be the swirl. It might be the cinnamon bun chunks but from the moment I taste the first spoonful, it is bliss! It's been a while since I'd seen it but soooo happy I've found it again! Is is loaded with chunks of cinnamon bun like dough. I don't know what it truly is but it is amazing!\n",
            "Not what you'd expect from Ben and Jerry's. If I didn't know better if think it was some cheap store brand. The \"gobs\" of cinnamon roll dough are just those weird sugary chunks like in cheap cookie dough ice cream. Not like any of the other dough in Ben and Jerry's ice cream. I took a few bites and it sat in the freezer for months until we threw it out.\n",
            "Just not enough contrast in this flavor. It simply fails to capture the essence of a delicious cinnamon roll. It was a valiant effort, but it just wasn't enough for me to recommend the product to anyone. I love some of Ben & Jerry's flavors, just not this one!\n",
            "B&J Cinnamon bon ice cream is not just the best B&J flavor but also the most unique. I was hooked on this flavor, it was my go-to for a frozen treat. Then it disappeared. I was left feeling empty and unsatisfied. Did you know there's not even a competing cinnamon flavor ice cream made by any other companies? What's the deal with that? Why would cinnamon be so scarce from frozen tastey varieties?! ...heartbroken.\n",
            "This isn't one of the Ben and Jerry's crazier flavors where they have unusual combinations of mix ins and flavors, like half baked or milk and cookies. Still, it's an amazing flavor. This flavor is one of my favorite Ben and Jerry's flavors. Everything from the steusel swirls to the dough to the caramel base in this pint is solid, and I can't name anything I would want to change about it.\n",
            "Im telling you this is literally the best flavor!!!! But so hard to find not even the big name brand places like Walgreens and what not have it. Once you do find it it’s EVERYTHING, the chunks of cinnamon are to die for. Every bite is worth the find. Not to say I enjoy scavenging through stores to find it. But it is sooo enjoyable it’s crazy. MAKE IT MORE AVALIBLE PLEASE!\n",
            "I love cinnamon but the sugar in here is just too much\n",
            "I have had a multitude of ice creams all my life but none compare to this Cinnamon Buns one! This has been my go to ice cream for 6 years and will forever be my favorite. So hard to find but I hope this never becomes discontinued because I will probably never find anything as great as this one and will actually cry if it goes away!\n",
            "I tried this a few weeks ago and ended up buying 4 more pints before the weekend was over. It is by far my favorite flavor I've ever had! The only problem is that I want it all the time... If you could make it carb free, fat free and guilt free then I would live on it. Lol! I didn't think I was an ice cream person...I was wrong!\n",
            "This is it! This is THE one! I love this ice cream and won’t waste my time with any other flavor!\n",
            "It’s so hard to find though... I haven’t found it in my area for the past 3 months... and that’s why I came to check it on the website...\n",
            "yes, I am writing this review tomemcpurahe you to never discontinue this flavor!\n",
            "I bought this because my store was out of Oat of this Swirled. If you like lots of chunks this is for you! Unfortunately I couldn't seem to shake the flavor of licorice from the dough chunks. But I was impressed by how much dough they fit in the pint. Not my favorite, but definitely worth the try!\n",
            "Ice cream is my absolute favorite dessert. And anyone who knows me knows I always have a sweet tooth. In all my 18 years, I have never seen this flavor until yesterday. It is delicious, wonderful, and life-changing quite honestly. Because it was so hard to find but what a gem this ice cream is!!\n",
            "My favorite flavor, hands down. I can't express enough how amazingly delicious this flavor is. I literally have to draw upon the deepest recesses of my will power to stop myself from eating the whole thing in one sitting. Please please please never discontinue this one. I would be so grateful.\n",
            "This cinnamon bun ice cream is a fight in my house this is the only kind i eat its the best my husband eats other ben and jerry so i be yelling at his cause he'll eat the cinnamon bun smh selfish i will fight for the cinnamon bun its is heaven in a container just the best\n",
            "This one is all right, its a little to sweet for me all though I love the flavor combinations. Its to rich for my tatse.\n",
            "For those of us who don’t like chocolate, there is rarely an option outside of vanilla or a fruity variety. So I was so excited to find this. And I’ve introduced it to my chocolate loving friends and even they agree it is the best ice cream on the market!!!!\n",
            "I got it with a delivered pizza and instantly fell in love with the taste.\n",
            "This is my all time favorite ice cream in the entire universe!!! If you love cinnamon rolls, then this is the ice cream for you. The problem I have with this flavor is the availability in the grocery stores. It's hit or miss with it.\n",
            "This flavor tastes like eating a Cinnabon! I'm addicted to it! I tried it when it first came out and to date I have not found a flavor better-tasting than this one! Simply amazing! One spoonful and you'll be hooked! Guaranteed!\n",
            "This is not only my favorite B&J's flavor, but my favorite ice cream. Period. The ice cream, dough pieces, and cinnamon swirls are so fantastic that it's impossible to put a pint of Cinnamon Buns down until it's empty!!!\n",
            "This is my absolute favorite ice cream and I always eat the whole pint in one sitting. Nothing needs to be changed about this ice cream, please never discontinue. Is there anyway to get this in a quart?\n",
            "I had this at my local cinema and was instantly hooked. Move over Chunky Monkey... you have been usurped by this cinnamon dream. It's delicious, just the right level of cinnamon flavour. I love it!\n",
            "This is my absolute favorite flavor!! It’s not a sweet overload. All of the flavors marry together very well. I love the cinnamon bun dough pieces! Please NEVER EVER EVER EVER get rid of this!\n",
            "Every time I go to the store I search out this ice cream because it is easily the best thing I have ever had. The first time I tried it I accidentally ate the whole pint in under 30 minutes.\n",
            "Im so happy I bought this flavor ice cream. It was so amazing! There were so many pieces of dough my mouth is watering just thinking about it! I have to get myself some more!\n",
            "I love cinnamon buns, so I was thrilled to find this flavor! There is cinnamon in every bite...just like a cinnamon bun. It's hard to control myself with this flavor.\n",
            "Always a classic. Was delighted to see my Walmart carried this flavor when I moved to a new town. I will always buy this flavor over any other flavor or brand any day\n",
            "I have been buying this flavor since I came out the womb. I rarely buy anything else. For me, this is the best flavour of Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream out there.\n",
            "I don’t like chocolate, so finding a good ice cream flavor other than vanilla is difficult. This is the BEST!!! And all my chocolate eating friends agree.\n",
            "I am in love with this flavor. So many cinnamon roll chunks and the cinnamon swirl?!?! Forget it. The most delicious ice cream of ALL time.\n",
            "I have had this ice cream quite a few times and I've had to limit myself to one quart every 3 months because I could live off of this one.\n",
            "My hubby bought this flavor and let me tell you I couldn’t get enough my gosh B&J you have outdone yourselves with this one\n",
            "I picked this out when i was 12 because I knew I loved cinnamon buns.. this was 10x better than any icecream I’ve ever had.\n",
            "This flavor is by far the most addictive flavor. It's virtually impossible to stop eating, so o typically finish a pint.\n",
            "Why is this no longer at my Target and on clearance at Walmart???! Don’t you dare discontinue this glorious flavor.....\n",
            "We love cinnamon buns and when I saw this at the store I had to get some for the whole family and we all loved it.\n",
            "OMG, this is the best in my opinion! SO SO SO good. Add more strussel and chunks, overload that sucker. SO GOOD!\n",
            "So many times flavours don’t reach the UK. Is this because all of the additives that you Americans love so much?\n",
            "This is by far my fav B&J’s ice cream, I wish it was easier to find! 10/10 would always eat again.\n",
            "The best ice cream I have ever had! Every time we go to the store I can't resist getting it!\n",
            "In my top three. Rich flavor. They want eleven more letters but its all about the flavor\n",
            "I consistently buy this ice cream! It is my favorite because of its texture and taste!\n",
            "Ridiculously good, it's just not available in a lot of places like the others. Shame.\n",
            "I have been a dedicated Ben&Jerry's customer for a long time. First, I fell in love with Cherry Garcia. It was perfect. Finally ice cream had enough flavor with actual pieces of cherry! But then things changed...and I grew up. I grew up and I realized that my heart truly belonged to Half Baked. We were true soulmates. And I have eaten an average of a pint a week, ever since then, for years... I was certain nothing could ever superced perfection!!\n",
            "This flavor is a true cinnamon lover's delight! I eat it at least once a week.\n",
            "This is my favorite Ben & Jerry's ice cream. I just cant seem to get enough!\n",
            "Great flavor! My favorite of Ben &Jerry's! Taste like a real cinnamon bun!\n",
            "My absolute favorite flavor! If you like cinnamon rolls you'll love it.\n",
            "Tried first time at Ben and Jerry Vermont factory. Favorite flavor now.\n",
            "PLEASE always make this!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!! Cinnamon Buns 4 ever!\n",
            "Just tried this flavor and it's by far my favorite!!!\n",
            "Best ice cream and best flavor EVER! So delicious!\n",
            "Discovered this flavor in a scoop store in Kingston, Ontario years ago. It became my go to flavor. I would hunt it down where ever we moved to. ;) No other coffee ice cream is strong enough and has just the right balance of chocolate and coffee like this one. Got my niece hooked on it too. Sadly she lives in Vienna, Austria and can't get it. Any way this great flavor can make it to the EU?? Please! Lots of Europeans like strong coffee. In the meantime my niece came to visit Boston, MA this summer and she was very excited to have it again. It was a good as she remembered.\n",
            "I was so disappointed when my favorite B&J flavor (Coffee Heath Bar Crunch) changed to Coffee Toffee Crunch and the flavor went way down hill. I decided to try CCBBB. It is on beyond delicious. It is how I reward myself after hard work in the garden, or walking with my Mastiff, or other causes for exhaustion or for celebration. When I finished my taxes the first thing I did was grab the CCBBB out of the freezer ..... my reward to myself. I have recommended CCBBB to others and their reactions have been positive. Thank you B&J! By the way --- the Mastiff has to stick to vanilla!\n",
            "I am both a chocolate and coffee lover, and this is the single best coffee ice cream I've ever tried. The coffee flavor is so strong and there are many large chunks of rich espresso bean chocolate pieces. So much flavor...this ice cream really does pack a punch. Please NEVER discontinue this flavor, Ben and Jerry's! I stock up every month. :)\n",
            "I’ve tried all of the coffee flavored ice cream I can find in local stores and this one is easily the best. My only issue is that’s it’s not carried at many stores and I’ve had trouble finding it in the last month. Thankfully the B&J team assured me it’s not discontinued but the production is behind because of the pandemic. When things are back to normal please get this in more stores so more people will discover this incredibly indulgent and amazing treat!\n",
            "I bought this after a 3rd shift at work to get me through the rest of morning class at school. Its really quite strong and kept me quite awake!\n",
            "I adore this flavor. I have become quite a fan of stronger coffee over the years so this one is a winner. The coffee ice cream is definitely strong and just sweet enough. The espresso fudge pieces give a nice texture contrast and are a lot like eating chocolate covered espresso beans. Fortunately there are at least a couple stores in my area that have this one and I hope they never stop carrying it. Please never discontinue this flavor.\n",
            "I've been waiting for this flavor to come back to my area FOREVER! #InLove\n",
            "I used to purchase a different brand of coffee ice cream and they no longer make it...BUT then I found you! Oh how I love you coffee coffee buzz buzz! I have tried almost every brand of so called \"coffee\" ice cream and nothing even comes close to the strong, creamy coffee flavor of this wonderful ice cream...can you tell how much I LOVE this ice cream?\n",
            "This is one of my FAVORITES. I first tried this in the B&J on my college campus and fell in love with it. Unfortunately, when I got home, I couldn't find the flavor anywhere I was bummed. That was about 5 years ago. I never wouldve thought to check the company website. I just thought it was a discontinued flavor but NOPE, I see that for my area they're selling it exclusively at Target. Now all I need are coupons.\n",
            "I am literally addicted to this flavor!! I love it!! It’s the best coffee flavored ice cream ever. I know I sound like I’m exaggerating but I honestly mean every word. I buy at least 2 pints every weekend for my cheat meals. Eat like half a pint for the weekend nights. I’ve tried so many other coffee flavors because it’s one of my favorites but this one tops them all the strength of the coffee flavor is the best it doesn’t have that weird too creamy taste it’s just like adding some milk and sugar to a cup of espresso and a side of some dark chocolate which is honestly the best flavor combo ever just pairs so well. And I love the dark chocolate espresso pieces; I used to buy dark chocolate covered espresso beans and eat them and it reminds me of that with the light crunchy-ness of the beans in the chocolate. My literal worst fear is that I go to my grocery store one of these fridays and I find out that this flavor has been pulled or discontinued! If this flavor ever got taken away that would be the worst ever!! I mean I think I buy out this flavor at my store alone and waiting for it to get shipped sucks and is a pain. This is a lot just for a flavor of ice cream but as I said before I love it and I’m addicted to it. It’s the only coffee flavor ice cream I’ll buy. Thank for making it!!\n",
            "This is, by far, one of the best flavors I have ever tasted! Tried it on a whim, not a coffee drinker or lover of coffee, but because the store did not have my normal go-to flavor (NY Fudge Chunk), I thought I would give it a try. Now, I am eagerly searching for grocers in my son's home state so that he can buy it and love it too!\n",
            "I live in Taiwan, and we sadly get very limited flavors of B&J's here. However, this one is one I'm happy to have. Excellent coffee flavor with just the right amount of chocolate. I'm ashamed to say how many pints I ate this summer, when it was just too hot to even go outside (except to the Carrefour store for more ice cream!).\n",
            "This is my all time favorite ice cream flavor. The only downside is that I can eat it all in one sitting! It is so good, my family and I are obsessed. We even travel to get it because it is only available in certain stores around us. Wish it was available everywhere! Truly an underrated flavor!\n",
            "Hello from HOUSTON, TEXAS!!! All do B&J ice cream is delicious, but CCBBB has my heart. Every bite has a scrumptious bit of espresso...its like you have to savor the entire pint in one sitting. I load up EVERYTIME I SEE MORE THAN ONE. PLEASE KEEP THIS FLAVOR GOING....ITS MY SPA DAY FAVORITE!!!\n",
            "Got a free pint of the coffee ice cream from Market Street for my birthday!\n",
            "I love this flavor! Took one bite and couldn't put my spoon down. My husband also took a bite and couldn't seem to put his spoon down either. Love the big chunks of chocolate mixed in.\n",
            "I have loved this ice cream for years. For the last few months I have not been able to find it. I’ve looked at every supermarket and called all over town. Even looked into ordering on amazon, but out of stock. Is this discontinued ??\n",
            "We love this flavor, it has good, strong coffee flavor, and with the espresso fudge it's the best coffee ice cream out there! We haven't found it near us for a while and are glad to see it is still being made. Thanks Ben and Jerry!\n",
            "I absolutely love this flavor and so many stores near me stopped carrying it. I have actually abandoned a shopping cart and left the store when I found my favorite no longer on the shelf.\n",
            "This was not a hard one to love. Delicious ice cream with delicious espresso chocolate chips! Simple? Yes. Boring? Heck no! It’s so good and kept me digging till the end of the pint!\n",
            "Really great coffee flavor. These are totally worth trying if you dig coffee flavored ice cream. I would dive over others to get the last one in the case. These really are that good.\n",
            "This flavor is by far my favorite. If you're a fan of coffee and ice cream I highly recommend trying it. The only disappointment is most stores in my area don't carry it.\n",
            "I have been buying this since it first came out, and EVERYTIME (and he eats ice cream nightly) he eats this, he says' GOD I LOVE THIS ICE CREAM!\n",
            "Rich coffee flavor (not like the milky latte flavor of most other brands) and the chips augment that taste with crunchy texture!\n",
            "If I were on death row, my last meal would be a gallon of Coffee Coffee BuzzBuzzBuzz. Just joking -- it'd be two gallons.\n",
            "Coffee and chocolate are my favorite things to drink and eat. I get both in this cream! This is best ice cream ever!\n",
            "EXCELLENT coffee ice cream. I love the coffee and chunks of espresso chocolate.\n",
            "Best coffee ice cream in the world, hands down!! Never tasted better.\n",
            "I was so sad when my favorite coffee Heath bar crunch was replaced by toffee heath bar crunch. It is a total loss of flavor profiles - especially the change to the coffee base. Then the proportions changed in coffee coffee buzz buzz buzz so there is so little coffee ice cream in most of the pints I buy that I end up with at least 1/3 of the pint filled with the excess chocolate pieces after digging thru the pint searching for the tase of the worlds best coffee ice cream. I haven’t stopped buying pints because I love the coffee flavor and a portion of the buzz buzz is perfect.\n",
            "I love my coffee, and I had high expectations for this when it got my attention. It instantly became my all-time favorite, kicking Americone Dream out of the ring for a while. It's not overly sweet in a toothaching way, and the espresso component isn't bitter either. It's a nice little pick-me up when you're wanting your caffeine fix and a nice way to cool down on a hot day.\n",
            "I just recently came across this in the store and thought I would try it because how bad could coffee ice cream be? Unfortunately, I quickly regretted buying this products. The \"coffee\" tasted awful and the chunks tasted weird. Idk if the pint its self was just being sold by the store old but it didn't even look appetizing either.\n",
            "Started off with Coffee Coffee Buzz Buzz at my local Ben & Jerry's Shop in the '90's (it moved - & so did I.) It gave me a hit of that instant buzz buzz in the surreal shop setting reminiscent of the Grateful Dead & California vibes of the '80's. I could sit with my small son & continue my California Dreamin' of yesteryear.\n",
            "I consider this the single best commercial ice cream flavor I have ever had. Given that I can never find it, you must not be keeping up with the demand, that is if you made more you should be able to sell more and make more money. HELP! Please make it mare available!\n",
            "This ice cream is so freaking yummy! I've never had anything like it. The fudge is so good and somehow you can chew it and it's crispy, then it melts. And the coffee is a true kick to the face coffee flavor. Perfection!\n",
            "Great balance of coffee ice cream and fudge chunks. The fudge chunks have some coffee on them and it is heavenly. One of my favorites! Sometimes it is hard to find in stores...when I see it, I buy 2!\n",
            "Loved the crunchy pieces contrasting with the smooth ice cream. Coffee could be stronger though\n",
            "This is my all time favorite flavor. I’ve always loved coffee flavored ice cream but this takes it up several notches of awesome. Never get rid of this flavor!!!\n",
            "I grab this when I'm when I'm not in the mood for Chunky Monkey. It's like a mocha-chip with a bit of a kick. I like it. It's pretty good.\n",
            "I have been hooked on this flavor for quite a few years and am sad that it my grocery chain shows that it has been discontinued!\n",
            "Got this flavor for free cone day and it was amazing. Loved the pieces of coffee grounds inside the chocolate chunks.\n",
            "It’s so addicting. It’s hard to control myself and try not to eat the whole pint, I buy this in like batches.\n",
            "Wonderful taste -- my only regret is that my local shoprite frequently runs out.\n",
            "The flavor of this can't be replicated. Any other coffee ice cream is awful.\n",
            "My all time favorite out of all ice creams and I can't ever find it anymore!\n",
            "Great mix of coffee ice cream and chocolate chink. Not the usual flavors.\n",
            "The espresso chocolate chucks with this icecream are amazing.\n",
            "Ben & Jerry have outdone themselves on this ice cream\n",
            "This is by far my favorite flavor! I love it!!! YUM!\n",
            "I love coffee ice cream and heath bars, but try to eat them infrequently due to needing to watch my sugar and weight. On a nearly 90 degree day here in NH, I decided to indulge. What a horrible disappointment. The ice cream is ok, but after a few bites of toffee, I was done and tossed the pint. I found myself avoiding the crunch. So disappointing. I appreciate your dedication to non GMO, but I prefer strong labeling. I am a big girl, and can make my own choices. I just won't bother with B&J's if they sacrifice taste. This is not health food, there is no way this variant is any better for you than the Heath version, let's not kid ourselves.\n",
            "After you changed the formula and removed heath bars from this ice cream it’s tasted awful. I ate this ice cream every day for years when it was Coffee Heath Bar Crunch. This new Coffee Toffee Crunch is dreadful. Consumers have been complaining since you made the change and you have not improved the ice cream. I know how Business works so I am sure part of the problem is that you are lock into a contract with the new Toffee company but you are losing sales therefore you should get a new supplier. I keep waiting and checking for you to fix this formula so it could taste like it used to. Very disappointed.\n",
            "Not sure why a Ben & Jerry's employee responded to another customer that Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch wasn't a replacement for Coffee Heath Bar Crunch. On this very page you have a video stating: Coffee Heath Bar Crunch has a new name!\n",
            "Anyone who likes this flavor must never have tried Coffee Heath Bar Crunch because this is a sad replacement at best. And yes, I’ve read the multiple replies from B&J staff stating this flavor was not meant to replace it, but as others have pointed out, there is a video on the flavor’s page announcing its ‘new name’. I’ve bought this flavor more than once since its switch years ago, hoping for improvement over time, but still the toffee leaves a terrible aftertaste and the coffee ice cream lacks its once creamy, rich flavor. Ben & Jerry’s commitment to non-GMO products is admirable but please don’t this sacrifice the taste! Bring back the Heath Bar or give us a better replacement!\n",
            "I eat a relatively healthy diet and the coffee/toffee Ben and Jerry's was always my one real guilty pleasure that I would indulge in whenever I wanted something sweet. I admire the company's dedication to non-GMO/fair-trade products as I often eat a diet as low in non-GMO products as I can, but this new product really is dreadful. There is little flavor in the ice cream, and the toffee tastes like what you would expect from a sugar-free candy bar. I have bought it twice now, the first time was a surprise, and the second time was me hoping it was just an isolated mistake. Both were bad enough that I threw them away within a few bites. Major disappointment and I hope they take these reviews to heart and reconsider the product change.\n",
            "Coffee Heath Bar crunch has been my favorite flavor of icecream since I can remember. I decided to try the new product because I figured it wouldn’t be too much different from the original. I can’t pretend to eat it. Knowing what the flavor was to this?! No comparison. I read all of the responses from Ben and Jerry’s on this site and they claim that the point was to not replace the product. If it wasn’t to replace why was Coffee Heath Bar crunch discontinued? Have the Non-GMO (I mean, we’re talking about a treat here) and the original one if it wasn’t meant to be a replacement. I haven’t bought a Ben and Jerry’s product since and I used to have my freezer full. Such a disappointment.\n",
            "This ice cream is just disgusting. You say you weren't replacing Coffee Heath Bar Crunch but you were, I red it at the time. I get the GMO thing but as others have said ice cream isn't healthy and we can make our own choices. You keep telling people it is a manufacturing error IT'S NOT the ice cream is just BAD. Why are you treating your loyal customers like this. Fix it or agree that you can't reproduce one of the best flavored ice creams you had. It doesn't make the top 10 anymore but Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was always in the top 10.\n",
            "I noticed the name of my favorite ice cream changed in the grocery store today and tried it anyway - I figured swapping toffee bars wouldn't make that big of a difference but the coffee base changed too. It's no longer rich, the toffee no longer produces that sticky liquidy toffee pool. Instead, this toffee melts into a pretty gross dark brown grainy mess. The left over flavor is just yucky. Don't buy this. CHBC is gone and this is not a replacement.\n",
            "Coffee Heath bar crunch was my favorite flavor.\n",
            "I have recently decided to make my way through all of the B&J flavors (I have gone through an embarrassing number of pints embarrassinly fast..) and this was one that excited me at first sight. I love coffee ice cream and I love toffee, so I thought the two together would be a great mix. Sadly, the coffee flavor was very weak, and the toffee tasted almost metallicy. I thought maybe it was just a bad bite, but every piece of toffee had that same metallic taste, and all of the ice cream that touched the toffee was given that flavor as well. Overall, I was highly disappointed, and very saddened because this was the first flavor I have tried that I did not like. I will be throwing away my pint and not buying this flavor again.\n",
            "I love coffee, I love toffee, I don't care for this flavor. Strangely metallic flavored toffee. I bought this a few years ago and hoped that it had improved. Well, it did improve, but it still isn't great. It went from inedible to tolerable. This ice cream tasting bad just makes me sad. I don't want a refund, I don't want coupons, I just want this ice cream to taste good.\n",
            "I wish I had read the reviews, this ice cream is disgusting! I love Ben and Jerry’s and like to try new flavors but this was a huge let down. The ice cream has little flavor and the toffee is indescribably bad. Like other reviewers said it tastes metallic and like a sugar free candy. The texture is grainy unlike other Ben and Jerry’s ice creams. I was wondering if I got a weird pint until I read the other reviews. I threw the pint away it, it was inedible. I expect more from Ben and Jerry’s.\n",
            "I bought this the other day and was soooooo ready to dig in. Boy was I disappointed. Immediately there was a difference. The coffee has no flavor. It lost all the richness. Oh and the toffee bars. Ugh! Totally gross. This tastes like the diet version. I understand why you guys made the changes and I'm glad to support the cause. I guess I'll just have to find a new ice cream.\n",
            "Wife and I just bought a pint of the Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch because it has been a year at least since we had one. Today was a test to see if maybe had gone back to Heath Bar toffee. NOT. Whatever kind of toffee being used now is, apparently lots less money is the usual reason for change...big mistake. The Heath Bar version, I am betting, far outsold the present blend. The present toffee blend...we did not eat much of the pint, maybe total 3 spoonfulls. The rest...we tossed into trash.\n",
            "I used to keep track of what stores had the Coffee Heath Bar Crunch for those times when you just need a good pint of ice cream and a movie. Knowing that it isn't out there anymore is sad in a way the surprises me. And it's not like an old Atari you can find on eBay. It's just... gone. I didn't hear about the change but noticed it was really hard to find the flavor when I was looking for it. Then I found the Coffee Toffee Crunch and thought they might have just changed the name. Then I tasted it and thought I must have gotten a bad pint. Then I read the label and realized my favorite flavor was gone. I can only hope someday they'll bring it back. Maybe Health Bar can meet the free trade non-GMO requirements? What's so wrong with GMO anyway? Isn't that just called science? Isn't that how we cure disease?\n",
            "Maybe it's because I had never tried the original. But I love this flavor! It is one of my go tos! The coffee ice cream is delicious and the toffee is a tasty buttery crunch! Mmmm!\n",
            "Let me be clear: I want to give this 1 star for how disappointed I am. I threw in the extra recognition because the idea is amazing. I was fortunate enough to try the original with Heath, but sometimes I wish I never knew how heavenly it was. It hurts so much to lose my favorite ice cream flavor strictly due to an ingredient change. The toffee is mediocre and reminds me of the cheap caramel from my childhood. It’s a critical difference from the original, more buttery and crunchy delight. Please, for my sanity, bring back the original flavor or just put this flavor to rest. I can’t take any more disappointment when I see it next to my second favorite flavor, skipping this one every time...\n",
            "I'm so upset at the taste of this ice cream that I made my way to you're website just to express my concerns. Okay so I love coffee, especially coffee ice cream. When I stumbled upon this ice (which was in sale) I thought I found a a yummy treat. Boy was u wrong and disappointed. The coffee flavor isn't bad. But the toffee. Yuck. It has like a sour milk metal taste to it. And no its not expired and in eating the ice cream with a plastic spoon. Something is just not right. And with the other reviews, I know it's not only me who feels this way.\n",
            "I rarely buy B&J's but the CHBC was my fave, so when asked what kind of ice cream I wanted with Christmas dessert it was the first thing I thought of. I could hardly wait! Imagine the disappointment when met with this horrid excuse for coffee/toffee ice cream! I get the whole non-GMO thing, but is there no one making a decent non-GMO toffee bar that you could use? One bite and I knew it wasn't Heath - though I hadn't heard you were making a change. I complained pretty vocally so my sister actually showed me the container to prove it wasn't a generic brand. It was then that I noticed the change in the name. I wish I had known. What a waste! If Karamel Sutra wasn't so good, I wouldn't even look at the Ben & Jerry's section of my store's freezer.\n",
            "Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was one of my favorite ice creams of all time, but I can't even eat this. I get that some people have an irrational fear of GMOs, but that is no reason to manufacture a bad-tasting product. If you really can't use Heath then find some other toffee that tastes good; I imagine it can't be that hard to do. Until then I'm not buying this (and since you discontinued most of my other favorites, my overall Ben and Jerry's purchases have been and will be infrequent).\n",
            "Awful, metallic, bland taste. CHBC was infinitely better. Although B&J claims it was not a replacement, despite being dished out directly after CHBC was discontinued, it is clear that this was meant to appease CHBC lovers. B&J could not have been farther off in this assumption. This ice cream went straight into the trash after five people took a bite and determined something was \"off\" years ago. It was purchased again recently with the same conclusion. Awful.\n",
            "Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was my favorite B&J flavor. Bought this when they first made the change and thought I'd gotten a spoiled batch. As others have noted, terrible metallic taste, and the \"toffee\" tasted bad and had the wrong consistency--like a crunchy sponge instead of dense. Have never bought this flavor again.\n",
            "Today I was daydreaming about the original toffee heath bat crunch. It's been over 2 yrs since I've had been and jerrys. This flavor was the last one that I ate. It was horrible. Of course I was comparing it to coffee Heath bar crunch which was magical tasting.\n",
            "As much as you insist that this isn’t a replacement for Coffee Heath Bar Crunch, it absolutely is, and it’s a failure. How did you manage to find the grossest toffee bars on the planet to put in this abomination? And the coffee ice cream— icy and terrible. Awful, and substitution for the old delight that was Coffee Heath Bar Crunch— a flavor to which I would credit my bachelor degree, as it did its part in getting me through college.\n",
            "So coffee Heath bar crunch was my jam. I agree with many of the other reviewers that the toffee used now for this ice cream is really bad and leaves a bitter taste.... so disappointing because the old version was amazingly delicious. I know your comitting to non-gmo products so perhaps partner with a different toffee maker? or make a plain coffee ice cream. B&J's coffee ice cream base is great so I I would just buy that and buy my own Heath bars!!!\n",
            "I love the coffee flavors from Ben and Jerry’s and “Coffee Heath Bar Crunch” was my all time favorite so I figured this might come close... and no, sadly it doesn’t. The toffee is grainy and sweet, tastes very little of anything. The coffee ice cream is much less richly flavored, sigh. I had a few bites and tossed the pint.\n",
            "I understand what Ben&Jerry's is trying to do, but I no longer have a Ben&Jerry's flavor that I like enough to buy. Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was my favorite flavor and I bought it every single week. I tried this new one, thinking it must be the same thing with a new name; However, this toffee is horrible and almost tastes metallic. The taste of the ice cream is completely different. You're better off just buying a different brand of plain coffee ice cream and adding Heath Bars, or whatever toffee you enjoy, to that.\n",
            "I can't believe I am seeing these negative review's. I am a fan of ice cream in general. I live in Schenectady NY and if anyone doesn't know this where some of the best ice cream in the country comes from. That said... This is my absolute FAVORITE flavor of all time. Awesome flavors. Together! But it is hard to find now and there's similar flavors out there but none with big chunks of toffee in it! Plus the coffee flavor compliments the toffee so well. I usually stick to my local brands, but this is by far one of the best out there!!! Why can't I find it anywhere guys!?\n",
            "I check back every year or so to see if B&J has listened to their customers and gone back to the original Coffee Heath Bar Crunch recipe, but see they’re sticking to their guns on this one. This product used to be perfect and now doesn’t even taste like a treat. I’m shocked that the company would settle for this nothing-like-the-product-it-replaced substitute. Why would non-GMO and fair trade make it taste so much worse? Ben and Jerry’s are in the wonderful position to effect change by CREATING DEMAND for non-GMO and responsibly-sourced ingredients by showing how wonderful they can be: this does the exact opposite and actually hurts their cause. Dumbest business move since New Coke. After 4 years of hoping and waiting, I’m giving up on hope they’ll ever see the light or listen to their customers; This was my last appeal.\n",
            "After being a huge fan of the CHBC, I was quite upset when the new flavor came out and still am. The coffee ice cream and toffee bar is absolutely disgusting. The toffee doesn't have the flavor that Heath Bar or Skor does, and the coffee ice cream is also horrible. I asked somebody else to try this flavor after it changed and they also thought it was disgusting.\n",
            "Since they don't sell regular coffee by the pint, I used to settle for Heath Bar Crunch. The contract must have expired and they replaced it with some awful generic.\n",
            "Coffee is still good, toffee is inedible.\n",
            "So today I tried B&J's Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch for the first time two different ways (as is my custom): very firm straight out of the freezer and slightly softened after having sat out a bit. I give this flavor a \"meh\" out of five. The large toffee bar chunks, purportedly fudge covered [shrugging emoji], don't do justice to the coffee ice cream. For me the pinnacle of grocery store coffee ice cream is Trader Joe's Brownie Coffee Crisp ice cream sandwiches. If Ben & Jerry's can pint up their version of somethingverysimilartothat, I will probably bankrupt myself when I find it in stores! That combo of soft brownie, small, solid chocolate bites and coffee ice cream is my jam. But toffee slag? Not so much.\n",
            "This is my favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor. I have had trouble finding it in my location 65109 and 65101. I love the coffee flavor with the flavor of the heath bar and the crunch of this ice cream. I am gluten free and so may flavors have cookie dough which automatically eliminates those options. Love this ice cream. Please start delivering this back to the zip code locations of 65101 and 65109. I have not been able to find this flavor in Jefferson City. Miss this ice cream which is what prompted me to make this review. Love the ice cream flavor of Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch.\n",
            "I don't eat a lot of ice cream in order to try and avoid too much sugar. But I wanted a treat and Coffee Heath Bar has always been my favorite ice cream. I picked up a pint and was so looking forward to the indulgence. What an absolute disappointment it was. I originally thought it was me...maybe I had dreamed it up in my head that it had tasted better than it did in reality. I had some more the next day and it still was not good. I had my son try some and he agreed. I was not going crazy. The toffee pieces are just awful. I am all for the non-GMO movement but honest to God, I would gladly take the Heath Bars back regardless. It was a delicious treat that is now a huge let down. I truly hope that I can find some replacement :(\n",
            "Wow, eliminating my favorite ice cream for this dreadful concoction for completely non-scientific pseudo-science mumbo jumbo fakery reasons is just stupid.\n",
            "This is very disappointing stuff. I'm sure that the company that makes this tasteless toffee is very happy to have actually found someone to buy it. What's next...Phish Food with actual fish?\n",
            "Saw this little guy in the freezer section and thought to my self my two favorite things so why now try it?! Got home and had a bit and it rocked my world. This flavor is amazing!! Delicious notes of coffee and massive chunks of toffee!! Pure delicious bliss for me. I went back and bought two more!!!\n",
            "I wish I had read the reviews, this ice cream is digusting! I love Ben and Jerry’s and like to try new flavors but this was a huge let down. The ice cream has little flavor and the toffee is indescribably bad. Like other reviewers said it tastes metallic and like a sugar free candy. The texture is grainy unlike other Ben and Jerry’s ice creams. I was wondering if I got a weird pint until I read the other reviews. I threw the pint away it, it was inedible. I expect more from Ben and Jerry’s especially at $5/pint.\n",
            "It’s really not hard to make great-tasting buttery toffee candy. I used to do it all the time in my own kitchen, and I liked mine just as much as I like Heath bars. Please find a supplier of non-GMO toffee that doesn’t taste like a nickel-cadmium battery. Geez, maybe I’ll start up my own toffee company and underbid whomever you’ve contracted with just to save my formerly favorite ice cream flavor. (Well, second favorite of all time after Dastardly Mash — yeah, I go back that far.)\n",
            "This is my favourite flavour of Ben and Jerry's. The contrast between the rich coffee ice cream and the sweet crunchy toffee is lovely. My two main grocery stores appear to have stopped carrying it, and that makes me very sad. (I found this site because I was searching to see if Ben and Jerry's had discontinued it.)\n",
            "Would have given it zero stars, if possible! This flavor is awful! The toffee is terrible! I could and do make better toffee in my kitchen. This was a bottomline decision. GMO, Fair Trade blah...blah, blah...blah, blah. Ruining one of the best BnJ's flavors was a bottomline decision by the parent company, Unilever. If BnJ's was purchased by Hershey, Heath bars would still be in use.\n",
            "I used to love your coffee heath bar ice cream. But then you took away the heath and put in cheap toffee. Yuck!!! You totally ruined my once favorite ice cream by getting rid of heath for cheap toffee. Now I will NEVER by any Ben & Jerry's ice cream.\n",
            "I have tried the new blend of coffee toffee twice and the toffee is disgusting. Coffee heath bar crunch use to be my favorite flavor, but I cannot even chew the new toffee without gagging.\n",
            "Miss the full flavor heath bar and the big pieces. This is way off the mark leaving a nasty bitter taste from both the coffee ice cream and the toffee pieces. Will never buy this again.\n",
            "Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was one of my favorite indulgences ever since I started eating ice cream as a kid. Upon trying this changed version, I was so repulsed by the new toffee that I feel like I can no buy B&J's in the hopes that hear us on this particular flavor. I can at some level understand switching away from Heath Bars but there's plenty of ways to get a decent tasting non-Heath substitute (I've had a lot of good toffee in my time). But with this version it's like they're trying to make the worst toffee possible. B&J's product people please please please hear us!!! :(\n",
            "Coffee Health Bar Crunch was my all time favorite ice cream. When I went. To get a pint and saw the name change I was confused, but figured maybe it was rebranding of some sort, but when I took it home and tried it I realized I was wrong. Honestly, the new toffee is gross and I couldn't even bring myself to eat t.f he pint. So disappointing!\n",
            "The new chocolate covered toffee pieces are terrible. They taste like ash. This was among my favorite flavors back when Heath bars were being used. Shame it fell so far.\n",
            "The ice cream wasn't even coffee flavored and the toffee pieces left a bad taste in my mouth\n",
            "My mum got this ice cream last week and we finished the whole thing in two days. The crunchy, crispy toffee pieces laced in fudge was heavenly. I just have to close my eyes and enjoy everytime a piece of toffee gets in my mouth. How this flavour got such low stars is something I would never understand in this lifetime. Mum’s a huge fan of coffee icecream and she just can’t stop raving about it. For sure this flavour is something we’ll keep coming back to. It’s like the gold standard of all coffee icecreams that exist in this world. Thanks a ton B&J.❤️\n",
            "I just discovered Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch recently. I usually stick to Cherry Garcia, New York Super Fudge Chunk, and Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. But when I realized how much I love toffee, and saw this in the store, I thought I'd give it a try. I'm not a coffee drinker, but what the hey? Boy, I really like this ice cream! The toffee pieces are much bigger than I expected, and that's a plus! I read some reviews from people who enjoyed the Heath bar version, but not this one. I'm sorry they don't like it, but I think it tastes great. Thanks, Ben and Jerry and the ice cream team!\n",
            "One time my neighbor talked me into licking her metal swingset. It was winter and I was a gullible kid.\n",
            "Decided to try again since I heard changes had been made but the toffee is still not good. Please keep trying!\n",
            "Not the same since you are not using Heath Bar....I will no longer buy...It was gross...waste of money.\n",
            "Lover it so much!! Would buy again and again!! Miss the old version but still great!!\n",
            "I was highly disappointed with the flavor, much different than the Heath Bar crunch my wife and I loved! We ate a few bites out of this pint and looked at each other the same way, like, what the heck did they do to our ice cream!!! Ugh!! By the way, what the heck DID you do to our ice cream!?!\n",
            "I hear that you may go back to the old recipe. If you do, I hope that you keep this one too! I love it! Some complain about the coffee being bitter, but it offsets the toffee perfectly. Love that toffee too! I have to make a special trip out of town to find it, but it's worth going after.\n",
            "This Ben & Jerry's flavor is dangerously delicious!!!\n",
            "I love coffee ice cream and this one did not disappoint! I found it creamy and delicious. There are other brands whose coffee leaves me with kind of a thick disgusting taste in my mouth, but not this one! It was absolutely yummy! As far as the crunch, that part was a nice treat.\n",
            "Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was a magical concoction! Then it changed, and yes, it was gross and metallic for a while. But I have to say, it seems to have improved. It's not exactly the same as it used to be, but its much much better than the metallic one. I am 7 months pregnant now and it is 100% my biggest craving. Only one problem: I can never find it near me!!! The stores that are listed to carry this flavor never have it in stock, and now my poor husband is enslaved to finding it at all costs hahah! Please tell me how I can get my hands on a consistent supply!\n",
            "This is by far my favorite Ice Cream. I have a very poor appetite and even my doctors tell me I can eat as much ice cream as I want, I usually finish this in 2 sittings. The only problem is that my Giant Eagle runs out of it very quickly.\n",
            "I love coffee ice cream, and toffee is my favorite type of candy, so this is obviously a winner for me. I've seen a lot of criticism about the toffee in this but I LOVE it. It's better than heath or skor in my opinion. It's much crunchier and it has more of a buttery taste. Every time I eat this ice cream I wish that I could buy the toffee itself to snack on, Maybe Ben & jerry's could start making candy too?!\n",
            "This flavor is just so delightful. Robust coffee flavor tempered with the creaminess of ice cream, and crunchy toffee pieces, with bits of gooey goodness as you eat. It's really hard to get the right balance for a coffee ice cream, and somehow you found it! Such a great pairing with toffee! This Ben & Jerry's flavor I'll be returning to again and again!\n",
            "I try to be objective but it’s hard because this is the best freaking ice cream ever. Coffee toffee is amazing (and I’m a Mormon) and I will die if it gets discontinued.\n",
            "sorry to say i never tried your \"original\" but recently discovered this version: Coffee Toffee & must say: THANK YOU B & J - i am in love! cannot get enough of THIS flavor. gave up on anything else as a \"sweet treat\" won't be missing any of whatever it used to be. this is my Go-To, Gotta-Have-it ice cream, now & forever\n",
            "I bought this after coming back from a vacation where they had toffee ice cream and was looking for something to fill the void it left, and I'm so glad I did! This coffee is not over powering in its flavor, but is enough to make you taste it. The toffee is super crunchy and in big prices scattered throughout!\n",
            "Coffee Heath Bar used to be my absolute favorite ice cream and for years I bought it to the exclusion of everything else. Since the formula changed I've tried the \"new flavor\" (I get it, \"not a replacement\", sure) a few times and am always SO DISAPPOINTED. The toffee has a weird plastic-y texture and metallic aftertaste. This all natural non-GMO toffee tastes more fake than the good old Heath Bars ever did. And still missing is the absolute best part of the old flavor - the way the Heath Bars would melt a little into the ice cream leaving delicious gooey envelopes around the crunchy candy pieces. How long is B&J's Quality Assurance Team going to \"review\" all this negative feedback before they make a change? At least admit you aren't going to do anything, then I can just give up on it altogether.\n",
            "Honestly, I was shocked when I saw how poorly this rates on the website compared to most of Ben and Jerry's other flavors! I too loved Coffee Heath Bar Crunch, but this is a totally different product and I love it just as much. If you love toffee and coffee flavors, I think you'll enjoy this pint as much as I do. Just don't go in expecting Heath! This toffee reminds me more of a rich, handcrafted chocolate-covered toffee bar you'd find at a local chocolatiers shop. And it is so dang good.\n",
            "Yalls trippin if you think this ain’t the bomb. It’s got toffee, it’s got coffee, it’s smooth, creamy, has a great amount of toffee bits you can nibble on in between scoop sessions or you could save it for last. It doesn’t matter how you eat it it’s still one of the greatest ice cream creations ever to come out of a pint container and into your mouth.\n",
            "The perfect blend of sweet coffee flavor & toffee crunch! I just wish my local store would carry it more.\n",
            "Saw all the negative reviews and was honestly baffled (admittedly, I never had the Heath bar version). I love this ice cream! Toffee is perfectly crisp and didn't get stuck in my teeth (I was a little worried about that going in). And I love the rich coffee flavor of the ice cream.\n",
            "Nothing like the previous flavor. Won't be buying this one anymore\n",
            "The Heath bar crunch was my favorite flavor. After reading all the negative reviews, I was quite nervous about trying the toffee bar crunch. However, the new version is amazing! The coffee flavor of the ice cream is rich and deep, the toffee pieces are huge, and although they are not Heath bars, the Toffee is incredible. It does have a slight molasses taste to it, which is why I think people are saying that it tastes burnt. It doesn't! I am so glad they made my favorite flavor even better!\n",
            "I hate posting anything other than a glowing review of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream, but this... yeah. The coffee ice cream base is excellent, like all their coffee bases, but the toffee, while plentiful, is dreadful! I never had it with the Heath Bars so I can’t compare them; I can only go on this new pint I bought but the toffee is really terrible! I couldn’t eat it, not worth the calories. I bet it was glorious with the other toffee because the coffee ice cream is delicious.\n",
            "I tried this flavor my last month living in California and fell in love! It is the perfect amount of toffee and the coffee flavor is delicious. I never had the heath bar flavor that everyone seemed to love, but it makes me sad that everyone writes such poor reviews for this flavor. The poor reviews might make this flavor go away all together so please stop with the one stars! Since moving to Texas, I am completely unable to find this in any store in my area and am very sad.\n",
            "Please bring back Coffee Heath Bar Crunch. This flavor is a dreadful substitute and has made me lose my love of Ben & Jerry’s. Coffee Heath Bar was my favorite. I can hardly believe that switching out to this other toffee candy could downgrade this ice cream so dramatically. Please bring back Coffee Heath Bar Crunch!\n",
            "I keep hoping b&j would listen to the feedback and change the recipe again, this used to be my absolute fave flavor but since they changed the recipe it’s no good. I haven’t met anyone who likes it now. So sad I’ll never have that delicious coffee heath bar crunch again.\n",
            "Even if you can’t go back to original recipe, could you at least work on the current one and make it better??\n",
            "Just bought toffee bar crunch since I didn't see Heath bar crunch. Such a shame the new flavor was horrible compared to the original recipe. The vanilla ice cream was no longer thick and creamy and the toffee bar was terrible. No longer a Premium ice cream. Sorry B&J but I will not be buying anymore from you guys.\n",
            "Now, CCBBB is my favorite ice cream flavor of all time. Can this replace CCBBB? Not in a million years. However, the local stores in my area do not carry pints of it, and the nearest Ben and Jerry's scoop shop is an hour away. I was craving coffee-flavored ice cream one day and saw Ben and Jerry's was really one of the only brands that DO sell coffee ice cream. So I tried this. I think it was pretty dang good I just wish there was more crunch in it. If you have a coffee ice cream kick and can't get your hands on CCBBB, this is a solid alternative to crush your craving.\n",
            "I tasted this by accident. The store was out of the one I had been eating. It took a bite or two before it actually got me and “Oh Wow!” I was hooked. This is the most amazing ice cream I have ever had, hands DOWN! I could eat it every day in place of my meals. It’s that good!\n",
            "When this was Coffee Heath bar Crunch it was my absolute favorite flavor ever. I ate almost a pint a week. Since switching away from actual Heath Bar, the flavor is incredibly disappointing. The off brand toffee supplier is pretty bad. There's so much good toffee in the world... I don't understand how B&J managed to find a bad one. The flavor is ruined.\n",
            "Used to eat this flavor all the time when it was Coffee Heath Bar Crunch. The coffee flavor ice cream barely tastes like coffee anymore. What did you do? Blech... tastes like watered-down stale coffee that was left on the burner too long. Usually I devour a pint, but this one has been sitting in the freezer for a week ahead I've tried eating it 3 times now.\n",
            "I was so excited to remember how much i used to love this ice cream (formally of the Heath Bar variety). Then I dug into this new version. SO disappointed. It really is gross. Totally different texture and flavor. Overly sweet but bitter at the same time. Ya’ll need to reassess\n",
            "I guess they've changed the recipe since I last had it, because I was just disappointed with what I got this time. It used to be my favorite flavor, but it was just bad, with a metallic tasting toffee . Hopefully they haven't changed the recipes for all their flavors.\n",
            "We tried this flavor for the first time yesterday (both my husband and I are big coffee ice cream fans) and we both took one bite and spit it out because it tastes SO metallicy! Super weird. We made a friend try it too and she also agreed it tasted like metal. Not sure if an ingredient went bad or if it the recipe needs reworking but probably the grossest ice cream I have ever had. Stilll a huge Ben and Jerry's Fan but won't be buying this flavor again.\n",
            "At first I didn’t like it. But then the flavors took hold of me and I absolutely loved it! It’s my favorite flavor. Unfortunately, it’s harder to find but it’s the best!\n",
            "I kept thinking my taste buds had changed cause I haven’t had this ice cream in years but no the toffee and coffee are just bland and not at all worth the calories. Certainly a disappointment after having enjoyed the original perfection of coffee and Heath bars.\n",
            "The old coffee heath bar was my go to ice cream! NOTHING compared. Went to buy it one day and I hoped it was just the name they changed but boy was I so disappointed that the flavor changed, unfortunately in the worse way! Never bought it again and keep hoping some day it will be back! Glad to see I am not the only one who feels this way!\n",
            "I saw you changed out Heath bars for a non gmo version of toffee, unfortunately I absolutely hate this new flavor. Not sure it just tastes bland and off\n",
            "I echo the comments of everyone else who is disappointed and frustrated by the change to the recipe. The new toffee bars are not crunchy and I don't like the taste. The ice cream has also lost its coffee flavor. This used to be my favorite flavor but no more. Why hasn't anything changef if you have passing along negative customer feedback for over a year? I'd rather you discontinue this flavor altogether than keep making it in its current formula.\n",
            "I love this one. It combines my favorite flavors of coffee and toffee.... enough said. Now PLEASE bring it back to my area!!! Thanks!\n",
            "Tried this flavor yet again after Heath Bar was replaced. Unfortunately the toffee replacement is not good. Surprised this is still is a flavor, would prefer you to put it in the graveyard and bring back Chocolate chip Oatmeal cookie.\n",
            "My favorite ice cream flavor of all time. It only took trying it once and I was hooked. Marrying the coffee taste with the toffee crunch is heaven in my mouth.\n",
            "Please bring back your original Coffee HEATH BAR Crunch!! Very poor substitute. So disappointed.\n",
            "Delicious. I like it better before they switched from heath bars, but it is still my favorite\n",
            "Sad to see so many foodies complaining about this flavor in comparison to a previous similar flavor. I do love that the chocolate and toffee texture is not frozen rock hard so I am able to enjoy flavor as it melts in mouth. I’ve been looking for a similar quality in a regular candy bars, no longer enjoying some toffee bars I’ve eaten before. Makes me wonder how delicious this heath bar flavor was to cause such an uproar from others.\n",
            "The last time I had B&Js, I thought I was buying my favorite flavor \"Coffee Heath Bar Crunch\". I wasnt paying attention to the change on the label. Starting to eat it and it didn't seem the same. I thought, maybe my taste buds had changed, or something. But, then I read the label and realized why. I haven't had B&J since. Now I'm reading these reviews, and it's not just me. Boy, do I miss my favorite ice cream, well ice cream flavor\n",
            "My favorite flavor. Nothing can compare. I probably eat one a week. I was concerned with some of the lower ratings last year before I left for basic training that I would get out and it would be in the flavor graveyard. Lo and behold it’s still here. Can’t get enough of the toffee!\n",
            "My MOST FAVORITE ice cream!! Did liked the 'heath bar crunch better but now that I'm used to this...I love it as We'll! The only problem is slowly but surely all my stores are dropping it..:-( There is only ONE Target that I know of that still carries it and it's 25 min away.\n",
            "I do not recommend this product. Should not even be considered ice cream. The minute you added coconut oil it tastes chalky, metalic and poor texture. Also skim milk; why? This new product has more calories than the original version. Personally, when I choose this brand I expect true ice cream and ingredients. I do not care about how many calories or healther dietary ingredients. Make it the way it should be...\n",
            "This is just not what it used to be. It has looonggg been my favorite flavor but the new toffee bar makes it a no-go for me. So freakin sad about it.\n",
            "This ice cream I was worried wasnt going to meet my expectations...but it did! And the size of the toffee pieces were great! This combo is amazing!!\n",
            "This used to be our family favorite. We bought a pint almost weekly. But we haven't bought it in a few years. It's just not the same anymore. :(\n",
            "I feel like this flavor was made for me! I was astonished when I found it. I didn't realize other people like coffee and toffee too! I adore the toffee bar. Better than any I've had before! I'm eating it as we speak. Thank you! I also LOOOVE the big chunks!!!\n",
            "I miss the Heath bars for sure (I saw a response to one of the reviews saying that this wasn't meant to be a replacement, and people just aren't that dumb). But I could get over it, I still like the coffee flavor. But why are the toffee bar pieces so enormous? What am I supposed to do with an inch-long chunk of toffee in the middle of my ice cream? Chisel away at it with my spoon? Not a good experience, and it's happened in all of the last few pints I've bought.\n",
            "My wife loved the original flavor. She always said, whens she's pregnant she is going to eat this all the time. Well she got pregnant and there was no more coffee heath bar crunch. It crushed her spirits. Thankfully our local ice cream shop supported us through the pregnancy but the business would have been given to Ben and Jerry. Please bring back the CHBC flavor before we go through another pregnancy.\n",
            "This is my absolute favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor! I used to get it all the time, but the stores I went to frequently all stopped carrying it around the same time. I assumed it was discontinued. Imagine my surprise when I moved to NC, and there are actual Ben & Jerry's shops, and this flavor still exists! So excited to get Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch again after years of flavors that just weren't the same.\n",
            "I was very disappointed after eating the new version of the toffey coffee heath ice cream. It was by far the worst I've ever eaten. The ice cream with the heath bar in it is my favorite. I will no longer buy it due to the drastic flavor of the new toffee. Most people aren't buying ice cream at Ben and Jerry prices for their health, it's usually to indulge a little bit. So sad to see the change.\n",
            "Ben & Jerry's Coffee Heathbar crunch has been my favorite food of all for about 26 years. I no kidding had days where it was all i ate. When i was a paramedic in Williamsburg, VA there was a B&J's store where you made the best even better by being in sundae form, heaven it was! In the military, anywhere in the world I was if I could find some of this ice cream I felt at home. Now however, it's not the same. The removal of actual heath bars completely changed the taste. Gone are the treasure which was the little gooey pockets found next to a piece of Heath. I hate to say it, but it actually tastes bad. Didn't know it was possible for a B&J ice cream to taste bad but it does. The chocolate tastes cheap like cheap generic store brand and the toffee tastes & feels stale.\n",
            "I always buy coffee ice cream. I usually buy a pint of coffee/toffee at the nearby coop. The price is 9.99. My husband treated me to your Coffee a Toffee Crunch. The ice cream tasted like molasses. The toffee bits had no crunch and tasted stale. I tried it twice thinking I ate something earlier that would alter the taste. Second spoonful hours later still tasted like molasses.\n",
            "I'm shocked by the reviews of this ice cream. It's not the strongest coffee flavored I've ever had but when paired with the delicious and generously sized pieces of toffee it is fabulous.\n",
            "This was my dad's favorite and I like it a lot too. He walked me down the aisle for my wedding in 1996 and his reward was a pint. I can't believe people aren't reviewing it higher.\n",
            "I love this ice-cream!! I'm from Canada and it also appears that my fav grocery stores have stopped stocking this one. I hope it hasn't been discontinued in the Great White North.\n",
            "I like coffee ice cream. I like toffee. What could go wrong?? Ahh! That's right. The toffee pieces are too large, so large it's difficult to get a little toffee and a little coffee ice cream in the same bite. Too bad because toffee & and coffee go together like two peas in a pod.\n",
            "All the negative reviews are crazy. This is my favorite flavor by far! I love the giant chunks or crunchy toffee. No other ice cream maker has anything even remotely close. You're lucky if you get tiny slivers in other brands. My only regret is that it seems to be caffeinated so I can't eat it too late or it keeps me awake.\n",
            "Hands down the absolute best flavor made! No other coffee flavor even comes close! The toffee chunks are HUGE and the coffee flavor itself can’t be beat!!!\n",
            "I wasn't too sure on this flavor, but my local store at them BOGO half off, so since they were sold out on Strawberry Cheesecake, I though I would try something new. And I found it to be one of my new favorite flavors. I love that the toffee doesn't get stuck in your teeth like a regular toffee candy bar, and the coffee ice cream compliments it perfectly.\n",
            "This is the only ice cream im willing to eat. For everyone that doesnt like this ice cream your negative reviews has made it difficult for people like me who would like to find it at the grocery store. im on a ben and jerrys coffee heath bar crunch ice cream hunt and i cant find it. The gas station nearby was the only place i could find it for 6.99 and now they have discontinued it After reading these negative reviews now i see why its slowly disappearing from stores. it is absolutely the best ice cream on the market. my 2 favorite things combined coffee and heath make it easily my favorite ice cream. I would pay $100 to have a bucket in front of me right now, but it is like a mission to find it. i live by smiths in las vegas they dont have it, walmart doesnt have it, some albertsons may have it i think if im lucky but i havent seen it on this side of town since i moved. no ice cream compares to this one. i hope to find a store soon with it. <3\n",
            "I thought I'd really enjoy this flavor, like I do with all other flavors or b&j, but this one just doesn't taste good. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I was excited to try it, but was very disappointed once I got home only to have it sitting in my freezer ever since.\n",
            "I have always had a thing for this flavor and finding it around my area is hard. I recently stumbled upon it and was so excited to get home and take a bite. Not realizing they changed the heath bar to a toffy bar I knew something was different : (... I want the heath bar back!!! It's just not the same without it.\n",
            "I bought this one because I haven't been able to find my favorite Boom Chocolatta. I had high hopes for this flavor but the taste left much to be desired.\n",
            "It's quite expensive to pay $6 for a pint and take one bite only to have it take up precious freezer space :(\n",
            "I love this flavor ice-cream but it is so hard to find I know I might be one of the few that does enjoy it but I don't care i love coffee and the mix of the toffee and crunches it fills my sweet tooth I've even gone as far as ordering an entire case of this flavor for my family we all enjoy it on movie nights\n",
            "This used to be my favorite flavor. I hadn't bought this product in a while and didn't realize till I bit into one of the toffee pieces that it was no longer made with Heath bars. I understand their reasoning behind changing the toffee pieces, but this toffee is horrible. Tasted old and very oily. So sad!\n",
            "My wife loved this back when it used Heath bars but now she cannot stand it. The toffee no longer compliments the whole. Thankfully Americone Dream is unchanged so she still has an option she enjoys. I understand this B&J goal but flavor is still the most important consideration when it comes to ice cream.\n",
            "Bought it to try another one of the coffee flavors as cccbbb is one of my favorites and was thoroughly disappointed in the taste of this one.\n",
            "The coffee flavor is a lot more subtle than cccbbb which isn't a bad thing, it's quite enjoyable; the toffee on the other hand is horrendous.\n",
            "I have to sit with a bowl as I eat the pint to throw the toffee pieces into so I can enjoy the ice cream.\n",
            "Will definitely go into my \"never touch again\" category.\n",
            "When I first tried this flavor I instantly fell in love! Coffee ice cream is one of my favorites, and the addition of the toffee brings it to another level. I have had some trouble finding this flavor in stores recently and I’m very disappointed that it doesn’t seem to be carried in a lot of places.\n",
            "This has always been my favorite flavor from Ben & Jerry’s, but it’s hard to find. I enjoyed it with Heath, but this new toffee is much better! It’s more buttery and easier to eat frozen. It tastes like the more expensive English toffee they sell in tins during Christmas.\n",
            "This used to be one of my favorite flavors. Bought it today and didn't notice the name change. The bars have a gritty texture to them and is nothing like the Heath bars that were used. Disappointed. Really wish I didn't choose this flavor. Won't purchase again.\n",
            "Are used to love CHBC far that I’ve changed wouldn’t be that different. Boy was I wrong! The coffee flavour is so disappointing and the bar is granny with no nice coffee flavour I am so sad as this used to be a big treat for me and now I’ve had to waste a pint.\n",
            "I’m so disappointed. I loved Coffee Heath Bar Crunch. I picked this up, assuming it was a slight retool with a new, generic, toffee bar. It’s just not good. The texture of the ice cream is icy, not creamy, and the toffee bars are crumbly and one-note: sickly sweet. They remind me a bit of Scottish tablet. 3/4 of a pint still in the freezer and I don’t think I’ll be finishing it. I should’ve known...same disappointment when Mint Oreo changed to Mint “Cookie”. The essence gets lost in the translation.\n",
            "This is the worst thing you could have done to my most favorite flavor of ice cream ever!! This version doesn’t even come close in comparison to Coffee Heath Bar Crunch!!! Please bring back the original...this Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch stuff is awful!!!\n",
            "I found this flavor many years ago when it had Health Bar and I was sad at first when the toffee changed but I have learned to love the responsibly sourced toffee too. I like to try other B&J flavors but Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch is my true love!\n",
            "This used to be my favorite ice cream. I keep buying more to see if it will taste the way it used to but ever time I'm left feeling disappointed and sorry I wasted my money. It's weird how something that used to be so yummy is now weird tasting?\n",
            "I have been on a diet for a while, used my cheat day to share some ice cream with my partner. The “candy” you used to replace the Heath toffee is NASTY, what good is fair trade non gmo terd nuggets, absolutely the last time I buy Ben and Jerry’s\n",
            "Just tried this in desperation looking for my Coffee Heath Bar Crunch fix. What a mistake. The toffee is chalky. Horrible flavor. Can't compare to the Heath Bars they used before. Don't waste your money. Grab another flavor.\n",
            "My favorite Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream Flavor has always been Coffee Toffee Crunch, but the Toffee bars have changed. I think you used to use Heath Bars which are buttery and delicious and what a great combination to the coffee ice cream, but now the Toffee bars taste blah and I don't care for them in the ice cream. It makes the ice cream taste watery instead of buttery. Wish you would go back to the original recipe.\n",
            "i bought this flavor ice cream today. Its my first buy from the brand. I was ready to dig in. I was disappointed at the flavor. The coffee taste watered down. Not a rich flavor. The toffee taste odd. I didn't enjoy it.\n",
            "Now I wanna clear some things up here. This isn't a bad flavor but it seems as though it's getting a bad wrap. What a lot of people won't tell you about ice cream indulgence is that the mood/setting/amount you consume/way you consume all affect the experience. So let me start off by saying if you set out to finish the pint, you might not like this flavor, and that's fine, but just know you didn't enjoy this ice cream the way it was intended to be enjoyed. This is for the people who enjoy small servings of sweets. For those with more mature palettes. This ice cream deserves appreciation and admiration, and I believe the consumer but question where they're at mentally and spiritually before imbibing. Are there better flavors? Of course. But it's all about the time, place, feeling, and mode/way of consumption. This is enjoyable.\n",
            "I bought this about 1-2 years ago under the Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch name. It had pools of the tasty toffee throughout and the crunch bars also had lots of the gooey stuff. The coffee base was smooth and rich.\n",
            "When it was the coffeee Heath bar crunch it was absolutely stellar, but once they changed it, its really not good. It's the toffee. It's gritty, hard, and bitter which is a shame because the actual ice cream is good.\n",
            "I just purchased recently and first time ever trying Ben and Jerry because a co-worker highly recommended and i took about 3 bites and threw it out. It was bad. Doesn't taste anything like what I was expecting.\n",
            "Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was my favorite ice cream of all time. You destroyed it. The \"toffee\" is disgusting and crumbly, and the ice cream is flavorless. I don't even buy Ben and Jerry's anymore. So sad.\n",
            "The newer version is a sad imitation of the original. New toffee is not even close to the flavor of the Heath toffee\n",
            "I tried this after they stopped using Heath. It's terrible! I was so unhappy, I've stopped buying all B&J products. I can appreciate they are trying to improve the products, taste can't be sacrificed.\n",
            "I'm not sure I have ever been so sad as when this flavour was removed from Canadian shelves. It is my favourite flavour but I can't travel to the US just for ice cream. A nation has been deprived.\n",
            "I bought this on sale, and I see why. The bars are good, but the ice cream was the worst B&J's i've ever had.\n",
            "I just tried what I was hoping was still my favorite B&J flavor. What have you done? You are creating anti-non-GMO consumers. If avoiding GMO means substandard substitutes, No thank you.\n",
            "I loved coffee Heath bar crunch but this new flavor is nothing like it. Toffee tastes bad and barely a coffee flavor to the ice cream. I'll probably toss it out. Liked the old flavor better.\n",
            "Not sure why so many blistering reviews, it's not even as horrible as it's being portrayed. I love the coffee and toffee taste. I enjoy ice cream every now and then and B&J's is a good brand.\n",
            "I feel so sick after eating this .. I have tree but allergies and I feel like my throat is closing after eating this.... i am freaking out . This was my fav flavor but what happened ?!?\n",
            "The toffee choc pieces are tasteless and the coffee ice cream which used to be rich and intensely coffee is more like tea and instead of creamy is frosty-iced pcrystalline. Very sad...\n",
            "I don’t understand all these 1 star reviews! This is the absolute best ice cream and the actual toffee is far better in quality and taste then a Hershey's toffee bar. Perfection!!\n",
            "I love my coffee ice cream. And the LARGE chunks of toffee in this provide a perfect crunch without being too hard. I appreciate the size and quality of the toffee. Brilliant.\n",
            "I love this flavour, it is my favourite! I think this is almost as good as it was with the original Heath Bar and appreciate Ben&Jerry's commitment and them being consequent.\n",
            "One of my favorites! The reason for replacing the Heath™ bar pieces was in honor of Heath Ledger's tragic passing #RIPHeath...The people rating it a 1 Star need Jesus!\n",
            "Was once one of the greats, but the toffee bars in this ice cream are no where near as good as the old heath bars were. Sorry; this one was t an improvement.\n",
            "I purchased this along with my favorite core ice creams just to try it out. May want to have this as a shake in the morning instead of regular coffee.\n",
            "Tried this flavor on a whim and I loved it!! If you like Heath or Scor candy bars you’ll love this. There a huge chunks of toffee. Sooo good!!!!\n",
            "The coffee base is creamy and strong flavored and the toffee offers a delicious crunch. Also the perfect ratio of coffee ice cream to toffee!\n",
            "This one is my favorite flavor from this brand. I used to love the coffee heath bar crunch as well, but to me, this one is so similar, I don't see why so many are disappointed? The toffee is probably a bit drier than the heath bar, but overall, I still love this flavor, in fact, I have not been seeing it as much as I used to at my local Target and I hope it hasn't been discontinued.\n",
            "Not sure if I got bad pint or what, but the ice cream was icy and not creamy at all. the toffee was great!! ice cream more ice than cream.\n",
            "I never had it with the Heath bars so I don't feel like I'm missing out. I love coffee and toffee and this flavor is a hit with me!\n",
            "Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was my favorite treat. With the change, the ice cream isn't as rich, and the toffee is unappealing. :(\n",
            "I had forgotten my rule of not buying this flavor, and now $5 is basically going in the trash because this stuff is inedible.\n",
            "This is my favorite ice cream of all time! The Heath bar bites are yummy chocolatey surprises. I'm hooked forever!!!\n",
            "My all time favorite ice!!! If you are looking to try a new flavor, you have to taste this. I absolutely love it.\n",
            "Stop saying this wasn't meant to replace Coffee Heath Bar Crunch. For customers who like Coffee Heath Bar Crunch, this is obviously what they will go to since CHBC is no longer available & the name is almost identical & only the only ice cream you offer with coffee & toffee bits. Most are obviously going to compare the two & this flavor simply does not taste as good as CHBC.\n",
            "Never get rid of this flavor. Finally two of my favorite flavors and ingredients in one place!!!! Thank you\n",
            "I loved Coffee Heath Bar Crunch and honestly I wasn't able to eat it for more than 2 years since I moved to another country. When I got back I saw the name change. I still love it and unfortunately can only buy the small pint size version. I would really enjoy a bigger size!\n",
            "This use to be my hands down favorite ice cream, now I won't even buy it. The new toffee taste awful\n",
            "I tried this and went back and bought 4 more pints, my family and I are in love with this ice cream!\n",
            "This is hands down the best ice-cream I've ever had. I have no idea why it's rated so low...\n",
            "Love the huge pieces of Heath Bar. Yummy! Coffee taste like a creamy latte. Great combination\n",
            "The pieces of toffee bar are just killer. So yum! Might be my favorite coffee ice cream.\n",
            "The coffee flavor is washed out and the toffee is bland too. Sorry you diluted flavors!\n",
            "You guys really need to bring back the old flavor. The new one taste like metal and is disgusting. You discontinued your most popular flavor, who cares about gmos, you guys should be more focused on customer satisfaction instead of this PC garbage. Look at Amazon for example, they sell adult novelty items and whatever else and look where it has taken the company. This ice cream is trash and I refuse to buy Ben and Jerry's until you bring back coffee HEATH bar cruch.\n",
            "Such a rich coffee flavor. So creamy and huge chunks of toffee\n",
            "No way is this as good as Heath bar crunch. Not even close.\n",
            "By far the bets flavor! love the big Heath bar pieces!\n",
            "I just spit this out of my mouth. The toffee is gross\n",
            "Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was my favorite flavor. The Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch is the worst. It has a gritty texture, not sure what that could be. The toffee is horrible. I checked the expiration date even because I thought maybe it had gone bad. Coffee taste is OK, but leaves sour milk aftertaste. I can't believe ice cream can be this terrible.\n",
            "I bought this ice cream flavor because I love toffee and coffee. I usually get americone dream but I thought it might be good to change it up a bit. Boy was I sadly disappointed. The ice cream almost had a smoky, burnt flavor to it and the toffee did not mix with the ice cream at all. I won’t be getting this one again.\n",
            "I decided I wanted Coffee Heath Bar Crunch to help me get through quarantine for the coronavirus. Little did I know that B&J’s took away my favorite ice cream. I’m crushed...and apparently a lot of other people are too. Bring it back with Heath Bars no matter what you have to do with the company which makes Heath Bars.\n",
            "Seeing this on my weekly shopping tour I grabbed expecting as always a delicious ice cream that I would enjoy with pleassure and a little guilt because I tend to eat the whole Pint in one sitting. Added to that I love everything coffee flavored and Toffee just reminds me of good childhood memories.\n",
            "But this 5$ \"treat\" certainly did not remind me of anything remotly good. I did let the Ice cream get meldet a little and grabbed my spoon and wanted to indulge in. The pure coffe ice cream was passable , a little bit stronger would have been better in my opinion but hey everyones taste is different. What i really was excited for was the Toffee crunch. I grabbed a big spoonfull and tasted a really really big disapointment. It tasted all mettalic and even bitter. I even tried another one because I could not believe it. This was the first time I ever had to throw away a nearly whole pint of Ice cream. Let alone this makes me sade . After that I looked up the flavour on this side ans saw that many other Ben&Jerry fans had the same experience.\n",
            "To sum it all up I tried nearly all flavours and loved them all of course one more then the other but i would never reject an offer to eat one. But this Coffee Toffe Bar Crunch was not only a waste of my money but also a discourage for a huge supporter of the brand . Next time I'm gonna think about if I want to buy one of B&J's products or one of a other brand.\n",
            "Not the same flavor I once knew and loved. This used to be one of my favorites of Ben & Jerrys but I was sadly dissappointed after recently purchasing the new variation. Nothing against good old Ben and Jerrys but I was truly bummed after not having had it in years and finally deciding to treat myself. :(\n",
            "I got this ice cream from my local publix, and upon first bite, I was horrified. The toffee had a strange flavor, metallic almost, and combined with the icecream, was not a great mix. After having eaten the truffle kerfufflei was very disappointed, and sad to throw away a pint of your ice cream\n",
            "The heath bar cofffee had disappeared from my store. I then saw this new coffee toffee crunch. I was so excited, I bought three pints, in fear this may disappear also. My excitement was cut short when I tried the first pint. It was not heath bar coffee. It was a sad day as it was my favorite.\n",
            "Shame they replaced the old Coffee Heath Bar(TM) Crunch for this one. The combo of this version of the ice cream and these 'toffee bars' have poor flavor and terrible texture. NOTHING like the old coffee and Heath Bars in the older version. Shouldn't have messed with a good thing!\n",
            "I buy Ben and Jerry's icecream all the time(usually chocolate fudge brownie). I was very disappointed with the flavor and texture of Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch. It wasn't worth eating and this is one of the first times I've ever been extremely dissatisfied with B&J's icecream. :-(\n",
            "Saw the poor ratings and had to write a review to get it back up because if this gets discontinued I would be so sad! B&J marketing/distribution/whatever team, please do not get rid of this flavor! Make it extra delicious or whatever you need to do to get your fan base back but make sure it can live in our freezers for a long, long time.\n",
            "Always love me a Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, but this coffee toffee bar a kinda a disappointment. The toffee is crumbly and not so great tasting and is off putting to the delicious coffee ice cream. I would suggest if this flavour was redone, is to use skor bar or even just the skor toffee bits without the chocolate coating. I think the skor toffee and nuttiness will pair well with the delicious coffee ice cream.\n",
            "I’ve been enjoying this flavor since I was in grade school! I used to buy it all the time at the local corner store on the way home from school. I’ve been having the hardest time finding it at the grocery store now-a-days, but it’s still my favorite!\n",
            "I love coffee and toffee ice cream and I love that Ben and Jerry’s have put them together. I am from uk and the toffee pieces taste like little Dime bars. By far my favourite ice cream flavour will be looking out for it all the time!\n",
            "I loved Coffee Heath Bar Crunch! The new toffee in this Ben & Jerry's \"Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch\" is so bad. Please just don't even try it. They gave up taste for a no GMO product. Why??? I am not eating ice cream for my health.\n",
            "Loved the toffee coffee heath bar crunch. The new version is really bad. The toffee bars are dry and chalky with no taste. I have tried it a couple times hoping it was a fluke. I would rather have a plain coffee ice cream.\n",
            "I (like many others) was a fan of the Heath Bar Crunch. When B&J switched, I investigated as thorough as a consumer could. I discovered it had something to do with the Hershey's corp, and B&J had to come up with a toffee tasting replacement. So I gave it a try. It took a few pints, but I grew to love Coffee-Toffee as much as the Heath Bar Crunch. Its a little different, but it is good in its own way. This is the only food I've ever found that I can eat once a day and never get tired of it. I've probably eaten about 4,000 pints of the Coffee-Toffee (on top of probably 2,000 pints of the Heath). Sometimes, I get a pint that doesn't have quite as much of the toffee candy in it, so I buy a bag of the Heath \"Bit-o-Brickle\" Cookie bits, and sprinkle some on top, and it supplements the toffee nicely. Sometimes, I sprinkle in some Heath bits regardless of how much toffee is in the pint. I can't help it.\n",
            "Love Ben and jerry's ice cream but this particular flavor has an odd aftertaste the tofee bars in it were amazing and I seemed to dig for them since the ice cream wasn't that great.\n",
            "It was disgusting. Please ban all coffee ice cream. No amount of toffee can save this ice cream. Seriously disappointed. The vanilla toffee crunch, however, is delicious.\n",
            "Please please bring back Coffee or Vanilla Heath Bar Crunch ice cream. The new kind, coffee toffee crunch or whatever it is called, is horrendous.....just awful!!!!\n",
            "My favorite ice cream by far! I never tried it with the heath bar so I can't compare it to that. I just hope this never goes anywhere..but my belly!\n",
            "I was so addicted to this ice cream it's not the same but can't even find it any longer. Please return my favorite flavor.\n",
            "This has been my absolute favorite by far for years! Although I must admit I like to add a bit of caramel swirl to it...\n",
            "I have a sweet tooth that demands satisfaction and my “go to” was Coffee HEATH BAR Crunch. Probably the best ice cream in the history of the world. Then for some unforeseen reason (ok, I know it’s to be a better Fair Trade Partner/non GMO...) they took perfection and threw it out the window.\n",
            "I see so many folks complaining on here, but I don’t understand it. This ice cream is incredible! I am now wondering what I’ve been doing with my life in eating any other flavors. I love that this ice cream isn’t overly sweet and genuinely Tastes like coffee. I took a pint over to my friends home to make them all try this flavor, that’s how taken with it I was (they all loved it as well. Maybe not as fanatically as me...but what can I say, I’m passionate ).\n",
            "I want to let you know I buy your ice cream because of your ethics behind your food. I know that a good majority of people rely on willful ignorance with their purchases, but you vote with your dollar, and I feel much better funding something I can stand behind. Yes, consumers have autonomy to choose for themselves, but suppliers also have a responsibility to provide options for people like myself who wish to have integrity behind their purchases. If you miss the heath bars so much, go out and buy one and put it into your ice cream. You have the freedom to do that. I’m going to be eating this ice cream for the rest of my life, and this should be brought to any Ouija board event So I can enjoy it in the after life as well\n",
            "Used to buy this on a regular basis and now it's not here in the Pasadena, TX area. I wanted this so bad that I settled for terrible other ice cream coffee brand (didn't want to use the correct name because it really was kinda horrible) and bought some Heath miniature bars. Oh well. Still not satisfied because I really want your product.\n",
            "My favorite of all Ben and Jerry's flavor. The heath chunks go well with the coffee.\n",
            "My favorite flavor!! My go to flavor at the Ben & Jerry's Store or grocery store!\n",
            "This used to be one of my favorite flavours. It was best when it had the original Heath bars in it. It was still acceptable when it had the Ben & Jerry's toffee bars. Now it just seems to have flat pieces of chocolate in it without any toffee at all. I just finished my last serving of this flavour. It isn't worth the calories or the cost.\n",
            "I'm happy they changed the type of candy bar. It now has natural flavors instead of artificial flavors. They should continue to make those kinds of decisions. Ben and Jerry's should be as natural as possible. It is originally from VT, after all.\n",
            "I was surprised by all the negative comments. I find this ice cream delicious\n",
            "Gee, I love this flavor & haven't had any issues with it.... Totally yummy!\n",
            "i love this ice cream and can never find it at my local walmart anymore! :(\n",
            "I love the flavor and the chunks of heath bars. Please don't disconintue!!\n",
            "Needed a treat that would be uplifting. Good to do something for me.\n",
            "The old coffe toffee heath bar crunch was my tried and true go to flavor!!! I loved it!!!! So I was bitterly disappointed when it changed to non heath bars- not even comparable- but being a fair person I tried it again recently to see if maybe it would wear on me. Nope, sometimes a girl just wants some gmo's if it means better taste.\n",
            "I can't believe people rate this so low, its one of my favorites!\n",
            "Toffee coffee and ice cream best things in the world combined!!\n",
            "Always my favorite! Should be higher rating! Love love lovve.\n",
            "I love coffee and toffee. On this heatwave, this is perfect.\n",
            "love the toffee bar and rlly lke the ice cream! great buy!\n",
            "Stop what you're doing and eat this ice cream. Always.\n",
            "This flavor is delicious, I hope you keep this flavor\n",
            "Yummy an it is my favorite snack to eat at midnight\n",
            "I found this flavor twice where I live. It was the best ice cream I have ever had. I went to buy more and never found it. Still check the Walmart’s here every week. I would buy this ice cream on every shopping trip but have only gotten to eat it twice. I still want more 3 years later. I am actually sad that I can’t have any.\n",
            "I discovered Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch about 2 weeks ago and I simply cannot get enough of it. I told my bestie about it and she has been searching high and low for it.\n",
            "This ice cream brought me into the world of coffee flavored ice cream. I would be a worst person if I'd never discovered this truly fantastic flavor combo.\n",
            "This has always been and continues to be my go to Ben & Jerry's! My only complaint is that occasionally the toffee bar chunks are too big, no big whoop.\n",
            "I've loved this ice cream my whole life (38 years). It's so creamy and has the best coffee flavor. I love that Ben & Jerry's took the initiative to change their ingredients to non-GMO, Fairtrade, etc. More companies need to follow suite. I just wish this flavor was easier to find- almost no one carries it!\n",
            "I’ve tried really hard to like this new version but it just isn’t good. Please listen to your customers and bring back this ice cream with Heath bars. Your sales will make up for any licensing costs. And we don’t care about the sourcing mumbo jumbo. We want you to source your toffee bars from Hershey Co.\n",
            "This is my favorite flavor! I love the mix of the coffee ice cream and the toffee pieces. And I love that the toffee bites are so big!\n",
            "This used to be much better. I agree with all the other comments re the metallic taste. The only good thing is that it's no longer available in Canada - so I'm no longer tempted to buy it to see if the problem has gone away.\n",
            "I still love B&J, but really need a good coffee version to be happy again.\n",
            "I really hope Ben & Jerry's does not listen to all the whiners complaining that it isn't Heath Bar in the ice cream. Truly, this is my favorite flavor! The coffee ice cream is divine and the toffee pieces are delicious! There are usually some nice huge chunks of it in there as well. So so good!\n",
            "I love Ben & Gerry's....they have some really AWESOME flavors. But this is not one of them. So disappointing. I was totally expecting a delicious Heath Bar knock-off. But no such luck. The ice cream itself is the usual B&G's quality, but the toffee bar chunks are totally sub-par. wah. :(\n",
            "Heath Bar obviously replaced by a salty concoction called toffee bar crunch. This used to be the only flavor I'd leave Haagen Dazs for. The coffee ice cream base still delicious, but I have to pick out all the big salty chunks of this horrible toffee. Perhaps add pecans or almonds instead.\n",
            "A storm of flavors blasting you in the mouth? When was a kid always ate the toffee heath bar and now it's there toffee I love it the same maybe more 5 star ice cream.\n",
            "I love coffee ice cream and I don't think I have ever hated it no matter which brand I bought, but this one was that bad. Major issue is the toffee bar pieces, they ruined the ice cream. Just get ride of this flavor for good. Brewed to Matter is really good though, that one I LOVE..\n",
            "I bought this flavor this past weekend and it was chalky and gritty. I checked the sell by date and it doesn't expire until next year. Couldn't taste the toffee well either. I love your other flavors but this one let me down, especially it being close to 7 dollars a pint at 7-11.\n",
            "I LOVED the Coffee Heath! This toffee is not good to me in taste AND texture. The coffee ice cream is delicious though. I ate just the ice cream and tossed the candy in the garbage which was disappointing. I'm afraid to try other flavors that I like in case you changed them too!\n",
            "Picked this up for the first time. It’s sooo good. I just kept eating and eating...\n",
            "Coffee Heath Bar Crunch was the absolute best B&J flavor. The coffee ice cream is still the best, but the toffee bars in this pint have a kind of taste I can barely describe - probably because it doesn't belong. This flavor is not a consideration for me anymore. It is a shame.\n",
            "Yes, I know this isn’t the original Toffee heath crunch flavor that we all loved, this flavor has improved greatly since it’s release and is still my favorite BJ flavor by far. Thanks BJ for keeping this masterpiece around for all the coffee ice cream, buttery toffee lovers!\n",
            "I so rarely get this wonderful Ben &Jerry’s Flavor! It is the perfect combination with a perfect crunch. A lot of perfect in one little pint!\n",
            "My absolute favorite! The perfect taste of coffee and toffee.\n",
            "I bought a pint today because the flavor sounded interesting. I was sorely disappointed when I took a bite and got grainy ice cream. It was even worse when I found a piece of the promised toffee and it was mush, no crunch or nice toffee flavor just mush.\n",
            "I grew up eating coffee heath bar crunch, and while I'm fine with this version, I wish there was more toffee. You get a few big squares in the middle, and then none for the rest of the container. Still delicious, just want more toffee. Nom nom nom.\n",
            "This has been my favorite Ben & Jerry’s ice cream for years. I could care less if it has name brand heath bar or a different toffee candy bar. I still think it tastes the same. It’s delicious! Thank you for continuing to make this ice cream.\n",
            "I expected the ice cream to taste like coffee coffee buzz buzz since they are both cofee ice cream. The ice cream tasted more like molasses than coffee. The toffee was disappointing also, it didn't taste like any toffee I've ever had before.\n",
            "I used to really like this flavor. But the last 3 pints have had literally 1 piece of toffee in them. Super disappointing. Thought it was just a fluke but I probably will not buy this again. I should just stick with Cherry Garcia forever.\n",
            "Luxury, decadance, uniqueness all in one pint sized tub.\n",
            "I LOVED the coffee heath bar flavor. Was my favorite. But with the name change and the formula change it tastes like a cheap knock off. The toffee has a burnt taste. Very unappealing. Please find a different toffee to use.\n",
            "This used to be my favorite ice cream flavor, but after trying the new version which does not use Health Bars, no more! The new toffee is disgusting. Why did they replace delicious Heath Bars? I won’t buy this again.\n",
            "This is my all time favorite flavor, the toffee is soft and buttery yet still holds the perfect crunch while simultaneously melting in your mouth. The coffee ice cream is on point, everything about this flavor is great!\n",
            "Used to be my favorite. Don’t plan to purchase again. Toffee is poor and even the coffee ice cream seems different, and not good. I expect better from Ben and Jerry’s. On a positive note, I do like the Urban Bourbon.\n",
            "I love the uniqueness of this flavor and it has become my favorite go-to for snack until the stores in my area stop caring it. I've been testing other flavours, but none have matched my love for the Coffee Toffee.\n",
            "Listen I LOVE the ice cream but the TOFFEE! The toffee is so delicious I picked it out FIRST ate it and then ate the ice cream. I am just blown away....if you don't sell separately can I get a recipe!!? PLEASE?\n",
            "I just discovered this ice cream recently and now my local grocery orders it special for me, and my friends, because we're all now addicted. I love it. It is the best flavor the is. Please always keep it!!!\n",
            "When I took one bite out of this ice cream, I immediately regretted buying it in the first place. The toffee bar crunch part tasted really odd, like burnt toffee. It is a shame because it sounded so good!\n",
            "This is my all time favorite flavor of Ben and Jerry’s. I couldn’t find it anywhere for awhile and came on here to find it near me. I’m happy to say I bought all 6 they had at my local bi lo. Heaven!!!\n",
            "I love the flavor of this coffee ice cream, but I'll have to eat this one for breakfast. It keeps me up if I eat it post dinner. I'd love to see a decaffeinated version! Love Ben & Jerry's BLM message!\n",
            "I started buying pint sized ice cream instead of going out for ice cream. Gave this a try and wasn’t disappointed. I wish the store where I do curb side pick up offered more Ben and Jerry flavors\n",
            "I just bought this from a local Shoprite. Toffee pieces were too flat to be crunchy. And it did not taste like coffee ice cream. Severely disappointed, as I dont eat much ice cream.\n",
            "My husband surprised me with this and I love it, my only criticism is that I thought the toffee pieces should have been a little smaller, maybe half the size for ease of eating.\n",
            "I grew up eating Ben & Jerry’s coffee heath bar crunch ice cream. It literally was the only ice cream I would buy in stores. Years ago it was replaced by this terrible copycat.\n",
            "Wow what a waste of $6. I spent more time scooping around the cheap yucky toffee than I did eating the ice cream. Heath bars would have been much better. Gosh that was sad.\n",
            "It Was Any First Time Trying This Flavor And Overall I Loved The Flavor But It Was A Bit Hard To Enjoy Because There Was This Grity Powdery Texture To The Icecream Itself.\n",
            "I bought this a few days ago. Only two pieces of toffee in the whole container. And a few tiny pieces. Very disappointing. Maybe it was the last container in the batch.\n",
            "The new toffee bars used taste waxy and are definitely not as good as the original Heath bars in the “Coffee Heath Toffee Crunch” I ate for years. Please change it back!\n",
            "I have bought this flavor loyally for over 10 years (since it had Heath bars), and enjoy it even more now. The flavors are perfectly balanced and it never disappoints.\n",
            "I've been eating coffee ice cream since I was a kid! This brand has some delicious coffee ice cream! I'm surprised by the bad reviews, but I love this flavor.\n",
            "I have been a fan of this ice cream flavors since the mid-1980’s\n",
            "It never disappoints, and is the best thing to ever rain down upon my tastebuds ever!\n",
            "This is by far my favorite ice cream flavor! The large chunks of toffee beat any other ice cream with toffee in it, and the toffee melts in your mouth.\n",
            "We loved Heath Bar, but this has very hard thick toffee that doesn't crunch. Tastes good, but wish we could have a softer crunchy toffee again\n",
            "Not a substitute for coffee Heath Bar Crunch. Did anybody taste this stuff before they put it on shelves? The brand has gone down hill.\n",
            "Literally the best thing I could put in my mouth. Not even my dreams could come up with something like this. Thank you Ben and Jerrys!!\n",
            "This is my new favorite ice cream. I love the coffee ice cream. Then it is amazing having these toffee chunks covered in fudge.\n",
            "I am so sad that you all changed the heath bar to toffee. The texture and flavor is not the same. Please bring back heath bar!\n",
            "you all are out of your minds, coffee toffee bar crunch is truly one of b&j’s best, second only to cherry garcia honestly\n",
            "This used to be my FAVORITE! The toffee bars are disgusting now, they leave a weird aftertaste. Bring back the Heath bar!\n",
            "Humans are GMO - there is nothing wrong with GMO and you reunited this ice cream by getting rid Heath Bars. Stupid!!!\n",
            "Has a disgusting metallic taste. I recommend only for people who like their ice cream to taste like blood.\n",
            "The ice cream is amazing and the toffee bars are sooo good. Not like cheap check out line candy bars.\n",
            "Just gave this a try tonight and I am very disappointed. Literally the worst toffee I have ever had.\n",
            "I have only been able to find this flavor one time and it is my FAVORITE!!! Ughhh... send me more!!!\n",
            "Dont be fooled by the low star rating this one is one of the best pints I ever had! EPIC FLAVOR\n",
            "Omg I love Ben & Jerry’s ice cream but this one was a flop. Ended up throwing away 2 pints :(\n",
            "This is by far my favourite ice cream to buy. Great coffee taste with large pieces of toffee.\n",
            "It's my absolute favorite ice cream. Unfortunately, I can not find it anywhere. So sad.\n",
            "I thought I was gonna break a tooth. The toffee pieces are much thicker than Heath.\n",
            "Coffee heath bar crunch was the best. This coffee toffee is junk! So disappointing!\n",
            "They non GMO ruined this flavor. To the graveyard with this one.\n",
            "Best flavor they have. So delicious. Cant go wrong with coffee and heath bar\n",
            "Love Toffee and Coffee together! I am sad when I can't find it at the store!\n",
            "bought it 7 years ago and have looked for it every since my for ever go to\n",
            "This is the only flavor I like. But it is rarely stocked in stores :(\n",
            "Love this icecream. It's an awesome blend of coffee and toffee. ❤️❤️\n",
            "My fav flavour, you can't beat coffee ice cream with toffee crunch!\n",
            "Very very GOOD ♥️..If I could I would eat this ice cream every day\n",
            "So so so bad! Won’t waste anymore time on this disgusting product.\n",
            "I am so happy I tried this flavor, it is now my new fav!!!!\n",
            "This is my favorite flavor. More stores need to carry this!\n",
            "Try it and you will always buy it!!! BEST combo everrr\n",
            "The perfect blend of toffee and coffee and crunch!\n",
            "I can’t even imagine comparing a nasty, trite, bland Heath bar to the fine, succulent toffee in this ice cream. A Heath bar belongs in a bland generic brownish ice cream made specifically for the commoners’ consumption, basically people who will never know any better; it certainly doesn’t belong in this delicious, palatable gourmet ice cream made by Ben and Jerry’s.\n",
            "I tried this ice cream for the very first time about a month ago, and now it is my once a month treat to myself. I didn't eat ice cream very often, but I'm a bit of a caramel nut. When i saw this flavor, I have in and broke my rule and got a pint, even though I was leery of spending so much on an unfamiliar product. I have a strict budget, and only allow myself to get a \"comfort food\" treat once a month, so that I'm not tempted to buy junk food when I'm really in need of that \"comfort\" factor. I'm SO glad I took the chance! This is the best caramel ice cream i have ever had! My only regret is that out only comes in pint containers.\n",
            "I bought this flavor a couple of weeks ago and it has now become my all time favorite ice cream! If you love coffee ice creams and caramel this is the perfect ice cream for you! Mixing the cold brew ice cream with sweet cream allows for a much more subtle coffee flavor and really emphasizes the trio of flavors goes together exceptionally well.\n",
            "This ice cream is so good that I’m eating it right now. I love Ben & Jerry’s and I love coffee ice cream. So when I went looking for ice cream I went to the 7-11 down the street. Had I known this was going to be so good, I would’ve bought the rest of whatever they had in stock!\n",
            "I absolutely love this flavor. We bought one pint and went back for two more, then we showed them to our friends and they went and bought some! The best flavor I’ve ever had.\n",
            "This is so good? I don’t usually like coffee icecream but this is amazing. Definitely has a lot of caffeine, but luckily I have adhd and am therefore immune.\n",
            "Bought one last week at a 7/11 and saw that they’re exclusive so I had to go back yesterday stock up on a few!\n",
            "To say I love ice cream is an understatement. I eat a pint of Ben & Jerry's every night (that is not a typo). I usually do half baked and try other \"exclusive\" flavors when I need a change. I saw this flavor at 7-11 and decided to try it. Wow! This is my new favorite flavor! It tastes like genuine cold-brew coffee, not a cheap, overly sweet imitation. The sweet creme ice cream gives the perfect amount of sweetness without being too much. And the slightly salted caramel swirls are to die for. The combination of flavors is the perfect balance. It's not too sweet or heavy and is actually refreshing. There's no chunks, so if you love creamy ice cream like me give this flavor a try! Tastes just like that popular chain's caramel frappuccino. Only problem is that I bought every one at my 7-11 and can't find any more! I'm absolutely in love with and addicted to this flavor and hope it becomes a staple.\n",
            "Dear Ben & Jerry or my life savers,\n",
            "This is hands down the best icecream I've ever had. I had bought two pints and during quarantine these have been the best sweets. I had broken my arm so it's been hard for me to get around so when I postmates it no one can find me this flavor! So I went on the hunt for a day and after 10 different locations I could not find this flavor! Please make this a permanent flavor so I can have this sweet treat again!\n",
            "I bought this tonight. I love Ben and Jerry’s, this flavor was the only one left at 7-11..... about four bites fixed my sweats craving, however- despite my love for coffee and my love for icecream - this just doesn’t taste quite right. Way too potent on the coffee side, and I like espresso straight. Not going to buy again :(\n",
            "so creamy and yummy, i love the chunks and swirls so much\n",
            "I have bought this flavor for years and it was my favorite ice cream EVER! However when you changed the recipe and took the HEATH out of it I noticed immediately! I thought I had bought a bad batch, and after a few bites threw it away. After 4 more batches with the same disgusting taste, I wondered why I was eating ice cream that tasted like rusty metal! And sure enough it was the NEW “Toffee Pieces”. They are so bad I can no longer eat this. What a tremendous disappointment. I could eat another brand of ice cream with a rusty spoon and it would taste less like metal than the New everything but the.....NEVER AGAIN!\n",
            "This is my go-to choice every time I'm needing a fix. It's close to being perfection in a pint. However, I miss the Heath brand chocolate covered toffee pieces. It just hasn't been the same since the switch. Am I the only one that thinks the current toffee has almost a medicinal or metallic taste? Would love to see a better toffee choice in the future. That's not strong enough....PLEASE GIVE US BETTER TOFFEE PIECES!!!\n",
            "This flavor is one of my favorites! I fell in love with it the first time I had it, it was packed full of peanut butter cups and huge pieces of toffee. However the past couple time I've had it I only get shavings of toffee, and a couple peanut butter cups. was there a recipe change? Smaller toffee and more nuts? Fewer PB cups? I'll still purchase this flavor! Just disappointed to not find large toffee pieces and more delicious PB cups\n",
            "I got this ice cream for the first time after finding out about Ben and Jerry's no nonsense stance agaisnt white supremacy and was not disappointed! Absolutely delicious, I ate every morsel I could get! The peanut butter cups were massive and delicious, the toffee pieces were really yummy for me, and the white chocolate was not overpowering, as white chocolate can sometimes be, but added a nice addition. I will certainly get this flavor again and am excited to try other flavors in the future!\n",
            "There is a complete lack of \"everything\" in this! I've had four in a row with no toffee, and very little of anything else. Seriously?? When you pay a premium for ice cream that is stingy, it is not premium, it is a waste of money! Very disappointed! Been a forever fan, but I'm done hoping it was a temporary issue, it has been consistently lacking. So sad, but time to say goodbye):\n",
            "The toffee isn't nearly as good as when it used to have Heath bars in it - it tastes a little more sour to me. But everything else is fantastic. This is by far my favorite B&J flavor.\n",
            "Ben and Jerry’s is hands down my favorite brand! As for this flavor, the ice cream is great, as are the peanut butter cups, but the toffee is not good at all. I never had this when Heath was used but I can imagine it was far better. The nuts were ok but I won’t be buying this flavor again. Others are far better. Sorry, folks.\n",
            "This ice cream was practically taken over by pb cups. While I do love pb cups, I wanted more of a variety in this ice cream. I only got two pieces of the toffee and less than 5 almonds. The white chocolate was there which was delicious but my favorite is the toffee and unfortunately it was lacking. Overall, it’s good if you’re in the mood for peanut butter cups.\n",
            "I bought this ice cream honestly because the supermarket was having a sale and they didn’t have the kind I originally wanted no brand shall be named being that I’m 38 weeks pregnant and can never make my mind up on what I want the list of ingredients sounded like a delicious combination of everything I wanted to try so I bought one. I thought it was vanilla ice cream with chocolate swirls but it’s not its Chocolate and vanilla ice cream togetherI honestly don’t even like chocolate ice cream but to my surprise it was delicious!!!!! . I would love to see more pnutbutter cups in there but beside that it was amazing.Now I find my self going straight to this brand and this flavor no matter if it’s on sale or not.\n",
            "So I just got this stuff from a local drug store because I’ve never had Ben and Jerry’s before. I was so excited to try it! Once I did, I had to spit it out in the sink. The chocolate, vanilla, and almonds are good, but the toffee covered fudge chunks tasted nothing like hoe they sound. They tasted like blood or rusty metal. Yuck! I thought I could just work my way around the blood tasting fudge pieces, but no, the metallic flavor was everywhere! Not getting this flavor again!\n",
            "I have no idea what it was but randomly through eating it I’d get this terrible taste in my mouth. I came to read other reviews and someone else summed it up perfectly. The toffee tasted like rusty metal! great idea, but something in this is off.\n",
            "I debated between this and Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch for quite a while but ultimately decided on this because of the Peanut Butter Cups, but there wasn't a single peanut butter cup, if you can believe it!? There was a very generous amount of large Toffee bars, which was nice, but it certainly did fulfill my Peanut butter craving. No hard feelings, just saying!\n",
            "5 years ago, Everything But The was my favorite treat. I ate a pint a week and I was in love. Then, one day, I opened a new pint of the ice cream and found that the Heath Bar part tasted a little funky. I thought at the time that I got a bad batch of the ice cream and bought a new one. Sadly, I realized that there had been a switch of the Heath Bar permanently. For the past 5 years, I have eaten around the metallic tasting toffee. I still love the flavor, but I beg that we can switch back to the original taste.\n",
            "This was my favorite ice cream in the whole world (five stars!) UNTIL the \"new\" toffee. From the other reviews I read, I know your other fans agree with me. And of course this applies to all your other flavors that have Toffee as well, that I USED to enjoy, like Coffee Heath Bar. I appreciate the Non_GMO/Fairtrade efforts, but can you please source Toffee that meets your standards and actually tastes good? The toffee is missing the buttery taste. Or maybe gets Hershey's on board with making some special non GMO Toffee just for you guys? I used to love digging for \"treasure\": the gooey, slightly melted toffee pockets were my favorite part. Now, I don't buy this ice cream nearly as much as I used to, but when I do, I dig around the toffee and throw it away, which is wasteful. I cant just add Heath bars to this myself because they will not get those gooey carmelly toffee pockets.\n",
            "This was always my favorite flavor. Lately, though, the Heath Bar pieces and Peanut Butter Cups are few and far between. Like almost non-existent. Just some tiny round balls of chocolate with almonds inside (I think), and flat pieces of chocolate. Are the new owners cheaping out? Please bring back the original - it was one of the best ice creams on the planet!\n",
            "When I crave ice cream this is what I crave. It's literally all of my favorite candies in one ice cream. But it's really hit or miss with the amount of candy in it. Sometimes I'm completely missing toffee pieces, or white chocolate pieces it just depends. There never seems to be a shortage of the peanut butter cup though. I just wish the candy ratio was more balanced and consistent. I literally never know what I'm gonna get when I buy this, but i still buy it anyway because even on its worst day it's still pretty darn good.\n",
            "I've never been disappointed with Ben and Jerry's in the few months I've been buying pints. I like to try a new flavor every time. The description of this flavor sounded to die for, so I snagged a pint. However, I'm very disappointed in the flavor of the candy chunks. The white \"fudge\" tastes like plastic or has some sort of chemical aftertaste and the toffee pieces taste metallic/rusty. The chocolate ice cream and the peanut butter cups are what enabled me to keep eating it and not throw it in the trash.\n",
            "My mom bought this flavor my entire childhood and got me hooked on it! Everything in it works seamlessly and provides a different, sweet, chocolaty taste with every bite! The inclusion of the two kinds of ice cream makes it even better!\n",
            "This was really good back when this had Heath toffee bars in it. Sadly this is not the case anymore. The new toffee bars are metallic tasting. On top of that all stores within 25 miles of me stopped carrying it. Might be the taste???\n",
            "Still a fan, but the loss of real Heath bar really downgraded the product. On my bookshelf I have an empty pint of the last container with real Heath bar in it, a happy reminder of a better time in a better product\n",
            "Why why why would you guys change my favorite ice cream?! Please go back to the old mix... Im sure people would pay a little more for it if that's the issue...\n",
            "I decided to try a new flavor, and this sounded appealing. Ugh, I was wrong. Hate the combination. Toffee pieces too big. I'll stick to the ones I know work.\n",
            "I but 7 pints of this a week and eat every one of them!!! I will drive to every store in my area if I cant find it!!! The best ice cream I've ever eaten!!!\n",
            "Everything but the... stuff I wanted!!\n",
            "Where's all the yummy stuff? Mostly just ice cream, very few chunks of yummies.\n",
            "My entire pint only had one piece of toffee. What gives?\n",
            "I've been coming back to this flavor for years. It hasn't disappointed me where I need to try a new flavor but I'm sure the others are just as good if not better! I always recommend this flavor and I am disappointed when sold out!\n",
            "This has been my \"go to\" flavor for years! It combines the best of everything (which means no cloying caramel)! I can never choose between chocolate and vanilla, so I don't need to with this flavor. I love the big peanut butter cup chunks, toffee pieces, and fudge covered almonds. These three items are my favorite mix-ins at any ice cream parlor. Most Ben & Jerry flavors are good, but this one is exceptional and 100% perfect.\n",
            "Not much going on here for me.. New York Supa Fudge Chunk kinda gal so maybe that's why!\n",
            "With all the peanut butter cups, chocolate toffee chunks, chocolaty almonds and white chocolate deliciousness, the only thing that would make this flavor better is whipped cream! But, I guess that's the but!\n",
            "Ok I saw this and saw the peanut butter cups and I was like yes I’m craving peanut butter lemme get this one. And then I bought it and there was 3 PIECES OF PEANUT BUTTER LIKE WHAT. It was LITERALLY all Ice cream I was not happy. And the other things like the almonds and whatever that other thing is was so so and there wasn’t much of that either. Yea like this is just all I’ve cream.\n",
            "I saw that this flavor had under 4 stars average and thought it was criminal. Here's my boost for an awesome flavor!\n",
            "This is my absolute favorite. I didn't really mind the switch from the heath toffee to the current. However, I recently brought a pint the other day and there was no toffee whatsoever in my pint. How are the batches being made now? It seems like for the price you would literally get some of everything. I would appreciate better service.\n",
            "Purchased a pint of this ice cream within the last couple of weeks at the local grocery store. The PB cups were not up to par with the quality of the other ingredients. Overall, just not a distinct taste to this pairing of ingredients. Disappointed, at best. Recommendations: Chunky Monkey (always); Truffle Kerfuffle (!).\n",
            "Everything But The has always been my favorite flavor even when they changed to different pieces. I love the blend of flavors and large chunks of stuff. However it’s not carried in stores around me anymore! I’m starting to worry it’s being discontinued.\n",
            "I get everything but the every night and yet the past few nights it’s been like freakin peanut butter cup lovers cuz that’s all that’s in there is peanut butter cups I’m getting very disappointed with everything but the now\n",
            "This is my absolute favorite ice cream and I came home from deployment to find that all the stores near me stopped carrying it because it’s discontinued it’s all I’ve wanted for the past year l, this is truly upsetting\n",
            "This is honestly my favorite flavor ice cream. However, I don't like the metallic tasting toffee pieces, I usually give those bites to my son that doesn't mind the metallic taste. Please get better toffee pieces!!\n",
            "If you like plain vanilla and chocolate ice cream with nothing else, then this is the flavor for you. If you purchase this flavor expecting PB cups, toffee bits, and white chocolately chunks look elsewhere.\n",
            "I bought this a week ago and took one bite and noticed an awful rusty iron taste as I bit into a very gritty something. I tried a few more bites and every single bite tasted like metal. Very dissapointed .\n",
            "This is one of my favorite ice creams, I have to hide it in a frozen vegetable bag in the freezer so my daughter and boyfriend don't eat it. The only thing it needs is a little more vanilla ice cream.\n",
            "What can I say? What's not to love? Two of my favorite candy. Toffee and peanut butter cups. Lovely combination. Only thing Want more pieces in it. Fully loaded please. Thanks Ben and Jerry's.\n",
            "This ice cream is the best ice cream I've ever had in my 20 years of life. I would eat it everyday if i could! Ben and Jerry, you are a blessing for my heart but a cruse for my body!!!!\n",
            "Oh my, and I thought \"Phish Food\" was going to be my favorite for LIFE. Well, I found my new favorite for LIFE! Great combinations and well blended. Big chunks and whole pieces GALORE!!\n",
            "I love this flavor. It is Devine. In May, for the first time ever, two of the things were not in the pint. I've kind of noticed this lately, I hope it's not the new owners.\n",
            "Let me tell you something people! If you have not tasted this ice cream, you have not lived. Every single bite is different and my god it's addictive! Very Therapuetic!\n",
            "I used to have one of this at least once a week and love the salted almonds, reeses ans heats chocolate pieces. Unfortunately it looks like only exists at US market now.\n",
            "Every bite is like a new flavor with all that’s in there! That said, I wish it were a little better. Maybe if the chocolate ice cream were richer. But still—its good!\n",
            "I love this ice cream! When I first tried it I was skeptical, but I love everything in this ice cream. I just wish it was consistently sold in my grocery store.\n",
            "This is the perfect blend of everything, especially since you don't have to choose between chocolate and vanilla ice cream! My favorite is the toffee pieces.\n",
            "This is the best flavour because it has a little bit of everything. Chocolate covered almonds, white fudge pieces, peanut butter cups... i want some NOW!\n",
            "This used to be my favorite flavor until they removed the toffee. I could not find even a single piece of toffee in the entire pint. Very disappointing.\n",
            "This is the best flavor... Can't get enough... It tastes like heaven.. Wish it came in a bigger size... Just finished a pint and want more...\n",
            "This is by far my favorite in the world i live 5 mins.away from borgata an they dont carry it...please please bring it to ben an jerry's their..\n",
            "The chocolate is rich, the vanilla is mellow and digging with the spoon is like treasure hunting. The peanut butter cups are like hitting gold!\n",
            "Every time I get ice cream cravings this is my go to! I’m not a big fan of dark chocolate but with the flavor combinations it works!\n",
            "This has always been my favorite, but can't find it in any stores in my location. I look for l look for it everywhere we go.\n",
            "This flavor is amazing. I absolutely love it. The only downside is I can not find it in any store near me now. COME BACK!!!!\n",
            "I rarely see this flavor while shopping but anytime I do, I have to buy myself some. If you love chocolate, you'll love this\n",
            "It's everything I want but not too much. It checks all the boxes of what a good ice cream needs. Nuts, chips and chocolate.\n",
            "I love, love, love the Ben & Jerry’s everything but the. I have been looking for months and cannot find it. HELP!!!\n",
            "This flavor is so good I don’t get why it’s reviews are so low!! It has a lot of components but I think it’s bomb\n",
            "My mom introduced this flavor to me years ago. It’s my absolute favorite!❤️ I wish this came in a 48oz.\n",
            "Seriously one of my favorite flavors!!! It's always hard to choose between this one and half baked!\n",
            "I bought this because it’s my favorite but it had toffee and no Reese’s and no white chocolate\n",
            "is it called this bc there is a limited amount of ice cream and its a lot of toppings-lmk\n",
            "This is by far my most favorite flavor and hope to see it stay around for a long time\n",
            "Anytime I want some Ben & Jerry's it's gotta be Everything But The... simply amazing\n",
            "The toffee pieces are just heaven. Perfect blend of flavors and all things great.\n",
            "Bought this too many times at this point, outrageously good ice cream\n",
            "The title of my review sums it up: Delicious!! One of my favorites.\n",
            "One of my favorites! So much goodness packed into one flavor\n",
            "My go to flavor fave! When I really want to treat myself.\n",
            "The regular chocolate ice cream usually isn't the best but the salty pretzel swirly really elevates it to a new place. The combination creates a salted chocolate flavor that really keeps you coming back for more. Marshmallow swirls are always a good option over mini marshmallows and the almonds add a good crunch. I rounded this up to 5 stars but I would be interested in graham cracker or some type of pastry chunks along with or replacing the almonds. I just simply don't love almonds. Overall 4.5/5 Very good. Worth buying.\n",
            "I found this ice cream last year and bought way more than I should have over the summer and cleared out my local Target in the Fall. I mourned the loss of summer and this ice cream until I happened across five pints at that Target close to the holidays! It was a Christmas miracle that I savored well into the new year. Then it was gone...again. I thought that was it until I saw it today back on the shelves. THANK YOU, B&J for bringing this back. I hope this is a permanent summertime flavor!!! The salty/sweet combination is PERFECT!\n",
            "Please bring it back B&J.\n",
            "I, myself, am not the biggest fan of ice cream, but I was stocking up for my husband, and I saw this exclusive flavor at Target. Got it home, tried it for myself, and went back the next day to get two more pints! I LOVE IT! The chocolate is so decadent. The marshmallow is scrumptious and the little bits of pretzel give it the perfect dash of crunch and salt. I cannot stop eating it. Dee-lish!\n",
            "I think Ben and Jerry’s does the best chocolate and fudgie flavors I’ve ever had, and this one is now exception. The pretzels were great tasting and nicely salty but was not so much a swirl and more chunks of pretzel here and there. The marshmallow was great and played well with the pretzel chunks against the chocolate background but honestly, the fudge covered almonds were kinda gross tasting and I had to eat around them. The real problem was that the pint wasn’t full! There was a big gap on the side of the container and that was rather frustrating. This came so close to being great but between the missing ice cream and the funky almonds, I think this one time will be my last for this flavor.\n",
            "I'd give this an 8 out of 10. The chocolate I good, and marshmallow swirl is awesome(which I love) and the chocolate covered almond chunks are fantastic. And it would be 10 out of 10 except the pretzel part is waaay too salty. if it were actual pretzel pieces it would be ok too But in the container I got, the pretzel part was like the texture of wet sand and just too salty. Zero crunch at all and no defined pieces. just this salty paste. But the chocolate, marshmallows and almonds are so good. I'm wondering If I got a bad container because reading other people's reviews of this flavor, they had pretzel pieces in theirs. which would have been 10x better.\n",
            "I tried this on a whim, and it is now my absolute favorite flavor ever! The combination of chocolate ice cream with slightly salty pretzel bits and globs of gooey marshmallow along with fudge covered almonds is just perfect. Please let this be a regular flavor and not just a limited edition. Pretty, pretty please!\n",
            "BEST FLAVOR EVER. The pretzel swirl is my favorite feature of any ice cream, and the fudge almonds are amazing with the salty pretzel. I was so disappointed when I stopped being able to find it in the store and really hope this flavor makes a comeback! I would make this a staple of my ice cream rotation :)\n",
            "I bought this last month and feel in love! The salty swirls are so delicious and the marshmallow took the show! I would have given this a 5 out of 5 based on that. But purchasing it again, it was basically chocolate ice cream with marshmallow. The pretzel swirls was NOT in my pint. Very disappointed in the hit or miss with the pints. I thought they was improving on this but that’s the second pint of this flavor with the skimpy mix ins. I get so disappointed when this happens being I only indulge once a week in ice cream so I want it to be good! Please work on this.\n",
            "On behalf of all pre menopausal women... don’t let this one go. Crunchy and salty and marshmallowey chocolatey goodness. Best pint of ice cream I’ve ever eaten.\n",
            "Love, Love, Love the Glampfire Trail Mix ice cream! This is the first ice cream that I haven't been able to put down and I must have ate it all, cause now I can't find it at any of the Targets. Please, Please, Please make it one of your staple ice creams. It is ridiculously good!! Nice job by the way!!\n",
            "I adore all kinds of chocolate ice cream and have a special place in my heart for Ben and Jerry’s (its always just perfectly rich) but this flavor is bar none my favorite ice cream of all time!! It was a seasonal Target only flavor so at the end of the season I bought 9 to last me until next summer!!\n",
            "Glampfire Trail Mix has chocolate ice cream with chocolate covered almonds, a marsmallow swirl, and a pretzel swirl. The base and almonds provide alot of chocolate flavor that dominates the taste buds when eaten in isolation. The salty pretzel swirl gives a nice crunch and heightens the chocolate, giving it a sort of dark chocolate taste. It's a little overbearing but luckily the sweet marshmallow swirl balances the other components out, providing a great flavor when eaten as a whole. Very close in fact to a rocky road but done better. The only problem is the amount of marshmallow isn't enough. Perhaps I just got a pint with less marshmallow but without more of it, the salty chocolate taste can be overpowering. A great flavor when all the components come together but a little too strong on the chocolate taste otherwise.\n",
            "Just picked up this pint today, and was blown away by how deliciously rich, textured, and addictive this flavor is. I loved the chocolate covered almonds, the rich chocolate icecream, against the gooey marshmallow, and the nicely salty graham cracker. I am no fan of those cloyingly sweet salted caramels flavors, so I wondered if the salted graham crackers would work. It was perfect! This would be my icecream s’more of choice. Please make this a regular flavor!\n",
            "As an avid ice cream enthusiast I’ve eaten my fair share of ice cream, but this flavor is hands down the greatest I’ve ever had. I stumbled upon it in summer 2018 and then spent an entire year searching for it at every store I went into for the last year. I just found it again and I bought the entire stock. PLEASE make this a permanent flavor! I never write reviews on anything.... but felt compelled to expressed my love for this amazing ice cream!\n",
            "If you like heavenly hash icecream, this is just about the same thing. The marshmallows are very creamy, and the hint of salt from the pretzels accents the chocolate and almonds perfectly. This might be my new favorite flavor! Thanks Ben & Jerry.\n",
            "Awesome ice cream! The add-ins to this ice cream are just terrific. The marshmallows and pretzels. I cannot stop eating this flavor. I hope you keep it in the rotation!!\n",
            "Just bought this this past weekend for the kiddos! My favorite flavor before was Half Baked, but I took a bite of my son's pint of this Glampfire Trail Mix and honestly was MIND BLOWN! The saltiness of the pretzelness mixed with the sweetness of the marshmallow is PERFECT. The perfect texture and you won't be bored because there's always complex, changing flavors throughout! SO DELICIOUS! This is our new FAVORITE\n",
            "This is the most perfect ice cream I have ever eaten. I can’t smell, so I love strong flavors, and this ticks every box. Sweet, salty, creamy, good textures - it’s like ambrosia. When I suspected Target was going to stop carrying it over the winter, I bought 20 pints from my local stores and boy am I glad I did. I’ve had one a week since then, and recently ran out. I PRAY that this comes back next year!!!\n",
            "No pretzel swirl in some of them! So disappointing! I feel you owe me my money back for lying to me.\n",
            "I have a lot of favorite ice cream flavors but this is the best one, by far. I am OBSESSED with it, and they stopped stocking it at my local stores as well as the big box stores in my town about a year ago. I'm super sad about it, and still scour the shelf every single time, hoping it'll come back. The combination of flavors in this one is just perfect, hasn't been matched.\n",
            "Glampfire Trail Mix is literally the best flavor of all time. I can’t think of anything better than rich chocolate ice cream with a pleasant sweetness and then BAM- salty pretzel, gooey marshmallow, and crunchy almonds. My local Target stopped carrying it during the winter months, and then there it was in the freezer section the other day....my heart almost stopped. They brought it back for the summer!! I jumped for joy like a little kid and bought a bunch of them. Never stop making this flavor. It’s life changing!\n",
            "I cannot believe this is not available everywhere!!!! I am a huge Ben and Jerry’s fan (like I get pints of B&Js instead of cake on my birthday).... this is my absolute favorite flavor! If I had a deep freezer I will just fill it with pints of Glampfire!\n",
            "This flavor is so close to perfect. Only way it would be better is with more marshmallow and pretzel swirl. So GOOOOOD\n",
            "This flavor has potential but needs better execution. The chocolate base is dark and goes well with the marshmallow swirl and pretzel swirl. There's some good texture with both swirls and a slight saltiness from the pretzel swirl.\n",
            "This flavor is now one of my top ice cream flavors of my life. The pretzel swirl is to die for, and the marshmallow swirl and almond chunks are a great addition. but really, that pretzel swirl is life. I hope it gets incorporated into more flavors! (In fact, a peanut butter world flavor with pretzel swirls might the best ice cream flavor I can imagine).\n",
            "If you’re a chocolate lover and enjoy the regular s’mores flavor you love this one! I knew when I read the ingredients that I’d love it. From the very first bite to the last, it’s a flavor that I’ll never forget. It’s the perfect blend of chocolaty sweet and a hint of salty that will send your taste buds on a journey\n",
            "I got this at Target and it was so amazing. I love ice cream and eat lots of it, and have tried many Ben and Jerry flavors. This was the best ice cream I ever had and my brother in-law agreed. Alas, I can't find it now and am heart broken. The lack of this flavor is driving me to try and make my own.\n",
            "I’ve been waiting for Ben and Jerry’s to bring back my favorite flavor. It was chocolate ice cream with marshmallow and Graham cracker swirls.\n",
            "This flavor is even better. It has the rich chocolate ice cream. The gooey marshmallow swirls. Slightly salty pretzel swirl and crunchy almonds. Perfection.\n",
            "I bought this flavor from my local Target last week along with a couple of other flavors. Figuring that, since I've come across a couple really good chocolate ice creams lately, I can't go wrong, right? Most especially with this being a B&J's flavor. But unfortunately, I have to say that this one missed the mark for me. :( I mean don't get me wrong, I had all the mix-in's, in the right amounts. But personally speaking, I felt like this was kind of another visit to salt lick city round two(first trip was via the Salted Caramel core flavor a while back), when I hit that pretzel swirl. I mean if I didn't eat straight from the middle where the marshmallow was and some of the not so salted part of the pretzels bits were or strictly the base that was on the outside of the swirl. I was just totally bombarded with a bunch of salt from the main part of the pretzel swirl. And it was soooo not good. Add to that, I am not quite sure what kind of fudge was made or bought to coat the almonds. But I beg of you B&J's, please find a way to tweak the recipe, some how. As I thought eating a couple of those would offset the salty flavor as well. But nope, the taste of that particular fudge just was not very appetizing to me. I'd recommend the fudge that is used to make the fish in Phish Food. But definitely not this new recipe. Sorry.\n",
            "Never have I ever left an Ice cream review and that stops here. Pretzels and ice cram go together like Freddie and Queen. I’ve been longing for a day where pretzels have made it into these precious pints and I will feel personally attacked if this flavor ever vanishes. Nice work B&J, prouda you.\n",
            "This is definitely my new favorite Ben and Jerry’s flavor. The pretzel swirl has that perfect saltiness that is so addictive and pairs well with the chocolate ice cream. The fudge almonds add a nice crunch and the marshmallow brings it up a notch. Great job on this flavor! Love it very much!\n",
            "This is exactly what I was expecting! The chocolate isn't too overpowering or overly chocolatey and the pretzel swirl gives just the right amount of pretzel flavor with a hint of saltiness. The marshmallow swirl adds a nice touch. Definitely my new favorite. I hope this one never goes away!\n",
            "Tried this flavor last week, was very excited for the combination but found it to be WAY too salty. I threw the carton out after a few bites. Very disappointed, could have been a great flavor. Spend your money on their better flavors, Phish food, Cheesecake, Half Baked, etc.\n",
            "This is my favorite flavor right now. The chocolate ice cream is reminiscent of what I remember having as a kid, the pretzel swirl is just the right amount of salty with the chocolate and the surprise swirl of marshmallow round toss pint out to make the perfect bite.\n",
            "Favorite flavor ever. I make special trips past my grocery store to Target for this flavor, with a backpack full of frozen packs, then run home as fast as I can so it's still frozen... because it never even sees my freezer before the empty container finds the trash.\n",
            "I LOVE this flavor. I'm nervous about it being an only summer time flavor so whenever I see it at Target it have to stock up! I hope this flavor stays in their normal rotation! When you get the pretzel swirls it is a great surprise with the chocolate. Sooooo good!\n",
            "I love, love, love this ice cream flavor and can't get enough of it!!!! Thank you, B&Js for coming up with this one!!! I now have my dad hooked on it, so I'm responsible for bringing it to him when I can find it. It truly makes my day eating this ice cream!\n",
            "I wish this wasn’t only in target... I have to drive to two sometimes three different targets to find it in stock. Hands down best ever. I wish there was more salted pretzel swirl because that’s my favorite part. B&J’s please sell this at other stores too!!\n",
            "This was the best impulse buy of my life. I’ve discovered my new favorite B&J’s flavor!! But I can only find it at Target, and the “exclusive” packaging makes me fearful that it’s gonna go away...say it isn’t so!\n",
            "I know this is only at Target, and I’m reeeeeeeeally hoping it’s not just temporary flavor! I need this to be available everywhere, all the time!!! Seriously obsessed with this flavor. Please don’t let it go away! My favorite since “The Gob Father!”\n",
            "I absolutely love this flavor! The only thing I don't like is that its an exclusive flavor. It's the perfect mix of salty and sweet while the marshmallow adds an extra creamy texture. Really hope I'm buying enough to turn this to a regular flavor...\n",
            "Discovered this one a couple months ago. I absolutely love it. Right amount of ingredients. So many other flavors just have way to many things crammed in there and I can't stand the core options. Please make this one permanent, pretty please!\n",
            "This ice cream would be in my top 5 favorite flavors. My number one is phish food and this tastes veryyy similar but in an original creative way! And it’s such a unique flavor. My only complaint is that it’s not available in all grocery chains!\n",
            "I absolutely love the pretzel swirl and chocolate covered almonds in the rich chocolate ice cream with a marshmallow swirl. The only thing I would change is I wish the chocolate covered almonds were larger!\n",
            "I bought this because I love chocolate covered pretzels, but the mix of pretzels, almonds, and marshmallow is absolutely unreal. It was as if this flavor was custom tailored to my taste buds.\n",
            "I have bought a pint of this every time I’ve been to the store in the last couple of weeks. Last time I went they were sold out and I died a little inside. Please keep this amazing flavor.\n",
            "I’m always trying to find the perfect balance between sweet and salty- and this is it!! The pretzel swirl is so delicious! I always buy multiple pints when I see this in the store.\n",
            "This ice cream is amazing- from the salty crunchy pretzel swirls to the gooey marshmallow to the surprises of fudge almonds. Please look at the reviews and make this permanent!\n",
            "This is literally the perfect mixture of sweet and salty. I would do anything for this ice cream and i can only find it at target. My absolute all time favorite, i am in love.\n",
            "I LOVE this new ice cream. The almonds add crunch and the pretzels are surprisingly delicious and compliment the rest of this perfectly salty sweet treat.\n",
            "In love with this flavor. One of the best you've produced - please keep it around and offer more outlets for it in South Dartmouth MA!\n",
            "Hands down best flavor out there, every bit of this complements each other, just fabulous!! It’s a must have, PLEASE keep it coming!!\n",
            "I absolutely LOVE this ice cream! It’s an obsession at this point. Would love to see more of it in the stores. Yummy deliciousness!!!\n",
            "ChubbyHubby is very rare up here in northern Maine. My go to is usually Phish food. I have FINALLY found the best of both worlds!\n",
            "A perfect balance of both sweet and salty as well as a perfect concentration of almonds throughout to give it a nice crunch.\n",
            "This is a great mix of savory and sweet and the ice cream is very smooth. It's quickly become one of my favorites.\n",
            "On Targets website it's \"no longer available\".\n",
            "That's a bummer going to miss my favorite B&J ice cream.\n",
            "My absolute favorite B&J flavor. Perfect combo of salty and sweet. I hope they never discontinue it.\n",
            "Nice mix of texture and flavors. All the ingredients stand out without overpowering each other.\n",
            "By far my favorite ice cream!!!! Hate that it is an exclusive flavor, don't want to see it go!\n",
            "The salty sweet crunch to creamy ratios are so perfect here. I am sad this is limited edition.\n",
            "This flavor is my new favorite and I am super picky when it comes to ice cream!\n",
            "I just tried it last night and I’m on my 3rd rub! Please keep in the market!\n",
            "This unseated my long-mourned, lost favorite, Late Night Snack. Excellent.\n",
            "This is the best flavor of B&J that I have EVER had! I need more!!!\n",
            "This is your best yet! The perfect mix of sweet and salty :)\n",
            "The. Best. Ever. Unreal tasty goodness in your mouth.\n",
            "I've been eating and basking in this flavor for as long as it's been around, but it's now awful. As pointed out by another, the cookie dough is like a stale malt ball now, and the brownie also sees degraded. But the cookie dough is horrible now. I thought this was a fluke, but I see it's happened to others and to me for the last month or so with multiple purchases.\n",
            "This flavor is amazing. Its everything you didn't even know you wanted all in one. Vanilla AND chocolate ice cream, chocolate chip cookie dough AND brownies. I can't drop my craving. Plus you get A LOT of the cookie dough and brownie, and I mean A LOT.\n",
            "I bought me a pint of Ben and jerrys half baked last night at QT reading the description excited to try it mainly because of the brownie chunks but there wasn't any brownie it was mostly just chocolate and vanilla ice cream with hard balls of cookie dough. And I paid 6.99$ bummer\n",
            "I bought this ice cream because I was having a huge craving and I found that sadly the negative reports are all true. The brownie was a crusty and dried out consistency and the cookie dough was quite dry and chalky. I am still a fan of Ben and Jerry’s (I used to work there and I also appreciate their sincere care for humans and the environment) and I hope this flavor does get fixed because it’s a complete mess right now.\n",
            "I really tend to stay away from sweet stuff but once i tried this flavor of ice cream on an impulse buy, i've been hooked since. This has been my go-to snack for 2 years and its constantly stocked in my freezer. Unfortunately over the past couple of months i've noticed a degrade in the brownies. What was once a gooey,chewy delight, is now an odd,kind of crunchy (not in a good way), cake that crumbles in your mouth like a bad cookie.\n",
            "About 3 out of every 4 pints i buy come like this and its grown to be a bugger. I know it may have alot to do with the shipment process, but this was not a problem before and i cant imagine the amount of first time tryers they are shooing away due to this error. This is my favorite ice cream and i hope this issue gets resolved.\n",
            "Just sat down to enjoy a pint! I dug right in , and noticed no gobs of anything!\n",
            "Half way through and still.... nothing.. just vanilla and chocolate .. oh wait... 1 piece of brownie.. :((\n",
            "The vanilla and chocolate was as good as ever! But misssing the gobs of goodness !! I am thinking... maybe I got the special pint??? :))\n",
            "I am a regular..sometimes daily! Pint eater.. so it won't slow me down.. I am guessing, better luck next time!? Hope so!\n",
            "Here is the upc # 76840 10132 just in case inquiring minds would like to know!?\n",
            "Bottom of container # is 84141103 maybe that will help get to the bottom of\n",
            "\" the missing gobs\"\n",
            "BTW... my favorite of all time was the penut Carmel cluster that was out,\n",
            "I believe Last summer! Any chance of it making its was back on the shelf?\n",
            "Over the last month, I’ve purchased 4 or 5 pints of this flavor, and ever single time, the cookie dough has been hard and slightly chalky, and the brownies have been dry, shapeless, and just... gross. Before they were distinct cubes of chewy, rich goodness! What happened? Is it a specific distribution center or something or did they change the formula somehow? This is my favorite flavor of Ben n Jerry’s, and honestly my favorite flavor of ice cream in general. But not the last month... Consistently disappointing is how I would sum up my experience.\n",
            "I bought this when I was out of my fudge brownie. I normally go for that one because of the bigger chunks of brownie but this is a go to favorite, Best of Both Worlds. You get brownie and chocolate chip cookie dough and they're not small pieces so when you actually get to a piece you are in for a real treat. the brownies remind me of the corner pieces of the brownie Pan and the chocolate chip cookie dough is sweet but has that little bit of salt that you get from eating an actual cookie but then the ice cream is vanilla and chocolate. Please try to tell me I'm wrong and try it out for yourselves you will love it!\n",
            "One of my favorite Ben & Jerry’s pints! I can’t not eat the entire container. The ice creams are excellent in flavor and texture and the brownie and cookie dough chunks are sublime. I actually eat this with one of my toddler’s little spoons so it lasts longer. Please never kill this flavor!\n",
            "I decided during our quarantine my wife and I could enjoy some half baked for a bit of indulgence and comfort. After devouring half the pint in a night we realized there was absolutely no fudge or cookie dough. Ice cream\n",
            "was still good but definitely disappointed. My quarantine is even worse now :(\n",
            "I have been buying a pint of half baked every week for at least the last 6 years. However for the last EIGHT MONTHS every pint has been a disappointment-either almost no cookie dough/brownies or when they are present they are dry, chalky, crumbly-not the gooey moist texture I had fallen in love with. Have tried from multiple stores even in different states with same results. So sad they changed formulation or something I used to look forward to this every week :( Hope they fix production issues soon\n",
            "I wanted a treat this evening but I had no idea what I was getting into with Half Baked. So good it is dangerous. The remains of the pint are deep in my freezer now but I feel the urge to set it free. Great balance of vanilla and a superb chocolate ice cream and generous bites of brownie. The perfect way to eat brownie, too - saturated with creamy rich ice cream. And THEN there is cookie dough, too! It ALL tastes good, together and individually.\n",
            "What happened to this flavor? During the last few months in Europe, there is no more cookie dough in this flavor. Replaced by some kind of white chalky substance that has an unpleasant texture. I threw away the first one like this, wasting 8e, when the second one was the same I ate it anyway thinking it must just be a recipe change and observed that the brownie is also compromised, like hard and stale. Now a third one is like this and I see similar comments. Something wrong here. Please fix it. How could this happen to such a flagship product without you noticing?\n",
            "Ben & Jerry's Half Baked Ice Cream is a treat sent from the heavens above. When I tell you I was eating this ice cream every single day....I am by no means exaggerating. You might be thinking, \"Oh she was just eating a scoop here and there.\" NOPE. I would eat the entire pint and go to the store the next day to buy another one. This went on for MONTHS! Now, I definitely had to slow down because eating that much sugar on a regular basis was making my thighs a little thicker than I would've like but, hey, I still curl up on the couch every now and then, turn on a good movie or tv series on Netflix, and eat my go to comfort snack, Ben & Jerry's Half Baked Ice Cream. This ice cream honestly shouldn't be as good as it is. It's a sin! A yummy sin...haha!\n",
            "I used to love this flavor and have been enjoying it for years. Unfortunately I had to stop buying it because every pint I have purchased over the past year has contained dry, chalky cookie dough - not the buttery, creamy dough that I grew to love. This flavor used to be so decadent. I sent a letter last year to let them know, but nothing changed after their response. I am pretty bummed that this is still an issue.\n",
            "I mean look it's simple every one loves gooie cookies An gooie brownies even the batter , An yes I've tried your brownie batter core ice cream but I'll save that for another time, because half baked deserves nothing but 5 stars An an a min for some gloating of its own lol you guys are awesome keep doing what you do , p.s your impact is far beyond ice cream, it touches homes An hearts everywhere<3\n",
            "I always loved Half Baked, but the last three pints I have purchased over the past few years (from various locations) have been awful. This is the second pint in a row that I have thrown away almost full. I am writing this review because I think the company needs to look into this. The brownie and cookie dough chunks almost feel like some sort of low-cal, diet substitutes of their former selves. They are chalky, dry, and difficult to eat. The ice cream is still good, but overall the experience is pretty terrible. I have to give up on this flavor. It's not worth the calories anymore!\n",
            "The delicious, fat chunks of brownies with such rich (but not too heavy, as it should) chocolate ice cream pair oh so perfectly with the decadent vanilla and old school cookie dough! 10/10 everytime, my go to.\n",
            "Ben & Jerrys Half Baked has been my go- to B&J flavor for a decade now... its delicious! It has all my faves in one- chocolate & vanilla ice creams with chunks of cookie dough & gooey brownie bits. Heaven!\n",
            "i would regularly purchase Half baked ahead of other pints. it is a close tie for favorite.\n",
            "However the past 2 months i've noticed the cookie dough seems flavorless and powdery while the brownies that once had a glorious chew feel more like cookies.\n",
            "it's a shame this has happened i think this flavors headed for the grave.\n",
            "Half baked has always been my favorite Ben & Jerrys. After not having it for a year, I saw it at my local store and bought 2 pints! Then to my disappointment, I found both the brownie and cookie dough to be dry. Usually the chewy fudge brownie is the best part! Not a crumbling dry mess. I hope this was just a bad batch...\n",
            "I tried this flavor for the first time and it's terrible. There are absolutely no brownie chunks and the cookie dough chunks that are in there taste like nothing. They are hard and dry. The whole pint looks and feels like dried cement. My pint had been out of the fridge for more than half an hour now and it's still as hard as stone. I can barely scoop out any icecream. The texture doesn't even resemble ice cream. I don't even now how to describe it, but I'll never buy this again. Waste of money.\n",
            "Never had any of these problems with other flavors.\n",
            "I love half baked, like love love it. But I have a pint that is totally missing cookie dough!\n",
            "I bought a pint of half baked after years of it being absent in my life. I expected a cookie and brownie bonanza, but my ice cream had NO COOKIE DOUGH and only TWO BROWNIE CHUNKS. I am severely disappointed and don't think I'll ever get it again. Shame because this used to be my favorite flavor.\n",
            "Like other have mentioned, the quality of this particular flavor definitely seems to have gone down hill. Use to be my go to flavor but now I find myself avoiding it more often than not.\n",
            "Most amazing flavor ever. It has the perfect blend of chocolate and vanilla ice cream with cookie dough and fudge brownie chunks. Highly recommend\n",
            "this is the third time I have gotten this flavor and the brownies and cookie dough were dry and really hard and crusty! inconsistent with this flavor becuase some pints its ok and really good, but its not consistant with quality\n",
            "This is hands down my favorite ice cream on the planet. I guess I'm fortunate that I almost never find it in stores, because i can't see it without buying it. A lot of people have complained about the change from Chocolate covered peanutbutter FILLED pretzels to chocolate covered peanutbutter pretzels (it is my understanding that this was due to the original pretzels no longer being available to B&J's). While I do thing that the original was better in principal, I found that I frequently got pints where the pretzels were soggy and disappointing. I have never had that happen with the new recipe. The new pretzels are always crunch and a little bit saltier, which I actually prefer; I need the salt to balance the fudge and vanilla malt. Still the best!\n",
            "Been eating Half Baked for years!!!!! I absolutely love it. Buy a pint every week. Since moving to Texas from Pennsylvania in 2017, I noticed the cookie dough changed and became chalky. Not sure why in Texas it changed. It's become luck of the draw, sometimes it's good and sometimes I get a bad batch. Lately it's gotten better. Praying it stays that way.\n",
            "I would buy Half Baked at least once every two weeks and I generally stock up whenever it goes on sale since this is my favorite flavor. In the past year, I have noticed that the cookie dough has been very chalky and not at all chewy like it once was. Additionally, the brownie bites are no longer chewy and distinguishable, instead they just disappear with the chocolate ice cream. I attributed this to the fact that I stocked up on this particular ice cream however even with more recent purchases I have noticed that cookie dough and brownie bites are no longer the same texture and quantity as they used to be. This is my favorite ice cream so I hope they are able to pinpoint what exactly is going on with the recipe since they have said they have not changed it.\n",
            "I bought a container of Ben and Jerry's expecting an awesome snack after a long day of work. I opened the plastic lid and scooped out maybe 1 cup. Not one fudge \"gob\" or chocolate cookie dough piece. So I came back the next day and had the rest. No fudge or cookie dough. It was just super disappointing and wrong that I spent $7.00 for a pint of ice cream that was mediocre chocolate and vanilla... Won't EVER be buying this again. Encourage everyone don't waste your money.\n",
            "Ten thousand years ago, a zebra and a pig bred, and the result was a cow. Immediately, humans realized the majesty, the pure tears of God that streamed from the cow's udders. This ice cream is the product of those ten thousand years of experimentation. Benjamin and Jerry have perfected conquered the world of dairy by creating the perfect ice cream: Half Baked. Never again will humanity ever reach this level of perfection in the dairy industry, nay, in anything. All hail the ice cream gods; and all hail their sublime creation.\n",
            "I hope this never gets cut, because this flavor is so yummy! It's definitely a basic flavor, but it's incredibly well-executed. The base ice creams are rich and delicious, and the mix-ins are HUGE! The brownies are rich with gooey, and the cookie dough pieces are spot on. Must buy!\n",
            "Half baked has always been my go to flavor. Although I have ventured out and found other flavors I love, Half Baked is always the one I eventually go back to. I can’t get enough of the wonderful chunks of brownies and cookie dough! Yum yum yum!!!\n",
            "Ben & Jerrys is a brand that represents society. This brand takes societal problems and they are able to illuminate it through its products and advertisement. Honestly, because Ben & Jerrys is a proactive brand that cares about the worth of human beings ,especially those of color. So, I have invested into their ice cream. This is a flavorful non-dairy ice cream and I love the ingredients. Every bite you a taste a new flavor and sometimes you can get pieces of cookies and cakes in your ice cream.\n",
            "I love the taste of the ice creme mixed with brownie and cookie dough, and this is the perfect mix!! Unfortunately, the brownie and especially the cookie dough was extremely dry and crumbly.. hoping I just had a weird batch.\n",
            "I recently bought this for the first time. As I sat down in a quiet house with a spoon and high hopes of enjoying this (all to myself) treat. Unfortunately the pleasure lasted about as long as the quiet did. The brownies which I envisioned at delicious rich chewy chocolate were more like gritty freezer burnt chunks and the cookie dough was dry and crumbly. This one won't go back in its hiding place behind the frozen veggies but front and center so someone else can easily find and eat it.\n",
            "Huge fan. Only flavor ice cream I eat. Unfortunately, noticing \"the gobs\" aren't quite there like they used to be. I might switch to the chocolate fudge brownie quart\n",
            "I would give it 6 stars if I could, thank you, Ben and Jerry's, you are a blessing in my life. I don't know how I could survive school without half-baked.\n",
            "Big lover of ice cream, Half Baked definitely is the best! Amazing tatste, so obsessed!\n",
            "Love this ice cream! Seriously have 2-3 pints in my fridge at any given time! YUM!!\n",
            "One of the best flavors that exists!!! Totally recommended!\n",
            "This is my all time favorite flavor! I love it so much!!!\n",
            "So f*cking good plz bless yourself and buy it plzz\n",
            "I've been buying this flavor for years now but for the last year or so, every single pint I buy is filled with hard, chalky cookie dough, and dry, shapeless, flavorless brownies. I would really like to keep supporting ben & jerry's but when the quality has been this consistently awful, it's difficult to. What is the problem? I buy it in New York City, is there some nonsense going on in a distribution center that delivers to my area?? It's so frustrating!\n",
            "Its been a while since Ive had this but I know it tastes very good. Rich in flavor. One thing about this brand, if the product states that it has a certain thing in it (e.g., fudge, cheesecake, cookie dough), just know that you will get nice chunks of these ingredients in every bite. This is what sets Ben & Jerrys ice cream flavors apart from the other brands. They are very consistent with their products. Would definitely recommend any of their flavors.\n",
            "What has happened to this ice cream :(\n",
            "It used to be my favorite flavor, now I'm too scared to buy it again. There were no brownie chunks and the cookie dough was weird and crumbly. I AM DEVISTATED! Why is this happening!\n",
            "I adore Ben & Jerry's and Half Baked is one of my all time favorite flavors, and my go-to comfort ice-cream. After a bad week I went a grabbed one from my local store and was so disappointed when the cookie dough and brownie bits were only a few at the top! 3/4 of the pint was just ice-cream without the yummy chunks! I was so sad:(\n",
            "I am not one to gravitate towards ice cream but while on a recent vacation my sister had this so I decided to give it a try. Man I have been missing out for years now! I have bought one every week since returning from vacation. I make sure to fit some every couple of days in my macros for a treat. This will forever be my favorite flavor. It has tons of brownie bites and cookie dough bites and the perfect amount of chocolate and vanilla. LOVE!\n",
            "I don't usually write reviews, but I had to for this one! I'm so glad I heard about Ben and Jerrys ice cream because I've been obsessed ever since I first tried it!! Literally the only ice cream I buy now! Half Baked is my favourite flavour, because I love cookie dough, chocolate, vanilla, and brownies of course haha basically everything about it! I can finish the whole pint in one seating lol. Seriously, I absolutely love it! It's so good! I can taste the fresh ingredients in every bite! And I love how the mixture of textures complement each other so well. Though the mixture of flavours, it's still light and creamy. I can eat it as a snack while I'm watching my favourite show or even for breakfast, lunch, or dinner haha! I honestly lost count of how many pints I've bought since the first time I tried it. I would definitely recommend it to everyone!!\n",
            "I love the smooth and delicious taste of the Ben & Jerry's Half Baked Ice Cream . The fudge brownie chunks, are CHUNKS! The cookie dough are grape size balls! I do notice some inconsistencies from batch to batch on how much of the fudge brownie and cookie dough bits you get. Imy spouse and I can not share a tub, and always have at least one pint each in the fridge. I reccomend anyone to try this product. Always satisfied!!\n",
            "Can you believe that up until a few weeks ago I had NEVER tried Ben & Jerrys before?! Half baked was the first B&Js that tried, and I immediately fell in love. Its sooo creamy, so tasty, smooth and rich. The chunks of chocolate and cookie dough are in every bite, which is fantastic! I cant believe Ive been missing out so much.. I have since tried several other flavours and love them all; but this is my # 1. Im hooked.\n",
            "I bought a pint of half baked and two pints of chunky money and they were all freezer burned when I opened them right after purchase. I was going to eat this with my family who is going to come over in a few days but now I can’t even eat it myself because of the awful freezer burn. There was also a severe lack of cookie dough and the brownie was stale. Very unfortunate and now I am scared to buy any more pints.\n",
            "This is my favorite ice cream brand. The chunks of all of the cookie dough are really big so you get the brownie or cookie dough in every bite. The ice cream itself is super creamy and delicious. I love the pint size because it can usually give you 3-4 servings depending on how much you eat at a time. I highly recommend everyone try and flavor of Ben and Jerry’s! The names of the ice cream are also very clever.\n",
            "This has been my go-to ice cream for YEARS! In high school my best friend and I would always share a pint over our Friday night TV binging. Years later I continue to have it and each time remember whythe fudge brownies are so rich melt in your mouth, the chocolate and vanilla ice cream are a perfect blend of not being too rich or too sweet. No other B&J has topped this as my favorite ice cream yet! Keep trying!\n",
            "Oh yum this ice cream is so full of stuff ,and is so good .it's creamy ,and full of surprise's with every bite .It is a little pricey for ice -cream ,but come on it's Ben& Jerry's so you know it's worth it .Unless you never had it then you should try it your missing out PLUS you love the single container .I love to share ,but some things you want all to yourself .What are you waiting for Treat yourself today.\n",
            "An instant classic for break ups, girls' nights, and sneaking bites out of the container in front of the fridge at midnight while your spouse is asleep. Perfect amount of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, just the right amount of cookie dough and brownie. Ben & Jerry's is definitely a tad over priced, but thank god for that otherwise I would eat this more often than any nutritionist would recommend.\n",
            "I bought this today for the first time. I've sampled it several times today and am eating it now. I won't buy this again. It's heavy and has a grainy texture with cookie dough and the fudge pieces are toohard. It's too much gook. My favorite ice cream is Cherry Garcia. It's light and has chocolate flakes and cherries and is perfect in every way. Cherry Garcia should be the No. 1 ice cream.\n",
            "I love Ben & Jerrys!!! They are definitely my favorite ice cream brand. Half baked is my go to flavor because there is so much going on. The only dislike I have that it is a little pricey for only a 16oz jar, but trust me its worth it! I just wish they made bigger tubs of it. But it is absolutely amazing!!!! Definitely recommend either Half Baked, Phish Food, or the Brownie Batter Core! :)\n",
            "I love Ben and Jerrys ice cream! Its so rich and smooth a full cream ice cream that is indulgent and delightful. I love half baked! The chocolate is Devine the vanilla is perfect! Its sweet and not at all boring or bland. The good brownie pieces are perfect and can there be anything better than cookie dough ? The problem with this is you cant have it very often or your pants wont fit.\n",
            "This is some of the best pints I've ever had from B&J. Incredibly, the textures of the vanilla and chocolate ice cream mixed with the brownie and the cookie dough are just amazing. Brownie is the mid-way between the softness of the ice cream and the crunchy sugar on the cookie dough and that makes basically everyone happy. From the rotating portfolio, this is by far my best flavour.\n",
            "I bought a pint of the Half Baked for the first time, about a month ago and I loved it! The texture of the icecream is smooth and the yummy brownie and cookie dough gobs give great substance to the mix. I haven't forgotten about Half Baked since that first round and just finished another this evening. I thought to myself, I could of eaten two of these pints! Dangerously Delicious :)\n",
            "This has always been my favourite flavour, but the last few pints I've purchased had been found to be lacking. After the first spoonful the rest of the pint had very few chunks in it. I would say about 5 or 6 small chunks of dough. A flavour that has the word dough in its name should live up to that. The last few times it hasn't, looking forward to seeing this improve in the future.\n",
            "This is my go to when I need a hug in the form of food. I can finish the whole pint in one sitting because I love the flavors and textures so much, so I have to check myself and put it away. Its definitely for chocolate lovers so if thats not your thing, youll probably think its too much chocolate. Its on the pricier side for ice cream, but its totally worth it. So rich and creamy!\n",
            "Oh yeah, I remember where I was the first time I tried Half Baked Ice Cream by Ben & Jerry's. Chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream wasn't necessarily a \"new\" thing, although it was still fairly novel and B&J was doing it great. The only thing that could have made it better was mixing it with brownie chunks and more chocolate. There's no other company that beats this flavor combo.\n",
            "Half baked is one of my top 3 Ben and Jerrys flavors!! The toppings are so good and the flavors work so well together. Also, the founders of this company are so woke. They were recently arrested at protests for the black lives matter movement. They stick up for whats right and they share their beliefs. I love Ben and Jerrys and if you havent checked them out you totally should!\n",
            "This is my (and my fiances) go to ice cream pint! It has the perfect blend of chocolate brownie pieces and perfect size and amount of gobs of cookie dough. Kind of pricey since you can get a half gallon for about the same price (about $4 in my area, $3 on a sale) but I love ice cream and its better for me to eat a pint in a day versus a half gallon. Also, always a great flavor.\n",
            "This was my first time buying a pint of Ben & Jerry's and I'm so glad I chose Half Baked! The cookie dough and brownie chunks were super good and the ice cream was nice and creamy. The only downside was that it was hard to scoop the ice cream because the brownie chunks were really hardened. Overall, it was amazing, but I'll have to stop myself from eating the whole pint!\n",
            "Half Baked by Ben & Jerry's is my ULTIMATE favourite! It's one of those flavours flavours that if you haven't tried it yet, you simply havent lived. Once you do try it, it will be your go-to choice of Ben & Jerry's too! A delicious blend of creamy vanilla ice cream, with fudge brownies (my favourite part) and gobs of chocolate chip cookie dough. Would highly recommend!\n",
            "This is one of my all-time favorite flavors. There's something about the combination of cookie dough and brownie bites that's just delish! My only worry? I have noticed that the ice cream to brownie/cookie dough has changed. I know find fewer dough/brownie bites in each pint. Hoping that they'll readjust that soon, or even better yet come out with a \"packed\" version.\n",
            "This is my go to flavor whenever I have extra money to splurge on ice cream for myself. I love the bites of cookie dough and then you have the bites of fudge brownie. Oh my gosh, it is just so good!!!!! If you like cookie dough and brownies YOU HAVE TO TRY this out NOW!!!!! Mmmmmmm.....no review will be enough to make you understand how good this one is.\n",
            "There was no cookie dough, the quality has really gone down hill. I used to love this flavor, now i am disappointed in the product.\n",
            "whenever i get sad/or i work my butt off i treat myself to this. i could honestly eat the whole pint in one sitting. its technically b&js number one selling ice cream for the past few years!! the chocolate and vanilla ice cream/ cookie dough and brownie bits all have a perfect ratio. if you dont want all the calories, they offer it in a froyo version too :)\n",
            "Oh my my my!! I LOVEEEE Ben & Jerrys Half Baked ice cream. I have on occasion ate a whole pint of this by myself. When Im craving something more than a simple flavored ice cream this is my first choice hands down. After a long day at work, nothing is better than a pint of good old Ben and Jerrys Half Baked, eating it with a spoon out of the carton in bed.\n",
            "This is definitely one of my ALL TIME fav ice creams. I literally always have atleast a pint of it in my freezer for bad days and my bf knows when it finishes to replace it because it's just what gets me through bad days. It's all things delicious in 1 ice icream. It's got fudge Brownie and it's got cookie dough... I mean really what more do you need?\n",
            "I love this ice cream. I just wish I could eat more of it for less calories, but who doesn't wish that about ice cream? I've used it to make my own popsicles by slicing it horizontally with a good knife, popping off the carton, putting a popsicle stick in it then dipping it in melted chocolate and refreezing. Helps me control how much I eat.\n",
            "My love for ice cream is deep and this flavor is seriously perfection. It has everything you want in an ice cream. I think I buy this every week its so good. It has the perfect amount of vanilla to chocolate ice cream with GOBS of cookie dough and brownie bites. The brownie is the most amazing part. I love you #ben&jerrys for making this!!!\n",
            "This is one of my all time favorite ice creams. It was a staple in my freezer in college. I love the creamy texture, delicious ingredients, and reasonable cost. I also LOVE that Ben and Jerrys pay all of their employees a liveable wage, are politically active, and donate to charities. It is definitely worth the slightly higher price point.\n",
            "Munchies anyone? I mean, come on, its Ben & Jerrys! Some of the best ice cream combos ever. You really cant go wrong with any of their treats. I cant say I have ever had a pint of B & J that wasnt drool-worthy! Plus, they have a great mission. *Doing a snap and this review applies to any and all goodies related to this brand of delishhhh.\n",
            "This flavor is AMAZING! It is my absolute favorite flavor of all! Ben and Jerrys brand. It is perfectly blended and absolutely delicious. I wish the brand wasnt so expensive because I would be able to eat it more often. If they ever came out with larger sizes at a similar price, that would be the best day of my life lol, its SO worth it.\n",
            "This is my drunk ice cream. The brownie batter, the cookie dough, ugh. Such a perfect combination and I could kiss whoever invented this. I will share this one because its a great pick me up and it doesn't make me feel the need to hoard it to myself. I want others to experience the same euphoria I feel when I get a nice glob of dough.\n",
            "I absolutely love this ice cream!! My all time favorite Ben and Jerrys ice cream! One of my favorite parts about this ice cream is it has chocolate and vanilla combined in it! The fudge brownie bits are so amazing as well as the chocolate chip cookie dough. 10/10 recommend getting this! [product:ben-&-jerrys-ice-cream-half-baked-16oz]\n",
            "Reading the description of this describes my perfect ice cream flavor. But, for some reason, Ben and Jerrys doesnt do it for me. I am not the biggest fan of supermarket ice cream, I would much rather get it from a parlor. Something about it tastes artificial and I cant get past it. However, its the best flavor out of all of theirs.\n",
            "This is hands down my favorite ice cream! A creamy ice cream base with delicious cookie dough and brownie bites mixed in. They are generous with the cookie dough and brownie bites too! My favorite way to eat this is to try to eat around all the added bits and save the bits (best part) for last and just eat spoonfuls of the bits.\n",
            "This is my absolute favorite ice cream. I love Ben and Jerry's. I love everything about them. The company itself is awesome. It's so sweet and delicious, they are all good but this is by far my favorite. You can find it anywhere. It's got chunks of cookie and they have a half baked core that has more cookie dough in it's so good\n",
            "Half baked is so yummy because it has all of my favorite things in it. It has chocolate and vanilla ice cream with cookie dough and brownie. It’s so yummy especially when it is at the perfect temperature, to me that’s slightly melted to make it soft and smooth. This is definitely one of my favorite flavors from Ben and Jerry’s.\n",
            "When I buy ice cream with chunks, I'm always disappointed with how few and little the pieces are. However, this ice cream is by far the most satisfying chunk-containing ice cream I've had so far! The chunks of fudge brownie and cookie dough are the size of my spoon AND are evenly throughout the pint. So ADDICTING!!!!!\n",
            "I love this ice cream. A perfect blend of chocolate and vanilla, brownie and cookie dough. The brownie and cookie dough are large and delicious in the ice cream. A classic Ben and Jerrys flavor that will never disappoint. And they make it in a frozen yogurt option too which is equally as delicious but fewer calories.\n",
            "One of my all time favorite ice creams. I especially love that I can pick up a pint of Ben and Jerrys and have my own little personal ice cream potion to attack through out the week when I want a taste. Hands down love Ben and Jerrys they have my business mostly when it comes to ice cream! Great company to support!\n",
            "SPECTACULAR! Despite the calorie count being so high (but let's be real here, its ice cream, what do you expect?) I try to buy this ice cream every few weeks. Half baked Ben and Jerry's is a million times better than their basic ice creams, and the different chunks and flavors are an absolute delight. Give it a go!\n",
            "Ben and Jerrys is my all time favourite ice cream because first of all it has so many flavours and this one is my fave. This one mixes cookie dough with brownies and chocolate and vanilla and I think maybe a hint of peanut butter inside and it is just so delicious I can literally eat one pot just to myself hahah.\n",
            "This is my go to treat of choice. Is is SUPER expensive though. $5 for a pint. However, it does have brownie and cookie dough pieces in it, so I get it. When I do treat myself to it, I almost always eat the whole pint in one sitting. It’s delicious, chocolatey, and the brownie pieces are so so soft. I love this.\n",
            "I bought a pint of Half Baked (my favorite flavor) and even though it said it was Half Baked, it was actually just a chocolate and vanilla mix with no cookie or brownie pieces. This is the second time this has happened to me in the past few months. Hopefully its just a production issue and not a new standard.\n",
            "Ben and Jerrys ice cream is known everywhere for their amazing flavor and quality. The half baked is my favorite, Im a huge fan of cookie dough and when you combine that with brownies it just does something for me. The texture is great, the ice cream flavors are incredible, and a little bit goes a long way.\n",
            "Ben and Jerry's makes amazing ice cream as I'm sure no one would disagree with. The quality is definitely there with the Half Baked flavor, too. I really enjoyed it, but I wasn't blown away like I am with some of their other flavors. Don't get me wrong, I won't turn it down, but I have many other favorites.\n",
            "I love Ben & Jerrys not just for the ice cream they have a really good quality ice cream but because the mission behind their brand did you know they hire recently released criminals and they pay the $16 an hour 75% of their income goes to paying back incarcerated youth I love them for that #PrisonReform\n",
            "This ice cream reminds me of getting my heartbroken by the douchebag I dated in high school. I didnt let my poor taste in guys ruin my amazing taste for ice cream. Half baked is so good and its my favorite kind of store bought ice cream to eat. I would definitely recommend it for the happy and sad times!\n",
            "LOOOOVE me some Ben&Jerry's ice cream!!! All flavors that I have tried so far are amasing! Very rich, full.of flavor delicious ice cream. I do wish the price was a little lower but then again you get what you pay for!!! So yesss, if you haven't tried it yet and you are an icecream lover, it is a MUST!!!\n",

            "This is my go to when Im just feeling gross. It has the perfect vanilla to chocolate ratio and the same goes for the cookie dough pieces and brownie pieces. Other ice creams that combine both usually end up with either too much off the brownie or too little of the other.\n",

            "Cookie dough & ice cream together is a happy blend for me. This is a combination I haven't seen anywhere else. It's good as is, but adding a chocolate ribbon through it couldn't hurt. (Just sayin') If you like chocolate & are a cookie dough fan, this is worth trying.\n",
            "This is my favorite ice cream in the world i buy one pint a month and its ingredients are high quality I love the plastic seal so I know it's not been pre licked lol. I always try new flavors but this one has been my fav since I first tried it years and years ago...\n",
            "Wasn't my favorite flavor of ben & jerry's not going to lie. I would like it better with more peanut butter flavor in the ice cream. I think if they added a little more flavor to it it would honestly be a favorite of mine. I'd give it a 3/5! Honestly could be better.\n",

            "I was so excited when I bought this, but when I opened it, I had to dig around to find the cookie and brownie gobs and was pretty disappointed with the amount :( I only got a couple pieces, but the few pieces I did get and the Icecream were as delicious as always!\n",

            "I tried this for the first time today, and it's amazing! I'm not sure what the other reviews are talking about- I don't think the cookie dough is chalky at all, plus you get so much of it! My favorite part, though, is that it's safe for people with nut allergies!\n",
            "Ben & Jerry's Half Baked Ice Cream is the best flavor! You get both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and both cookie dough and brownie chunks in one pint. If you haven't tried it, you should! The flavor is worth the price and I usually find it on sale quite often.\n",
            "I have never met a Ben and Jerry's flavor I didn't like. But this one is my all time favorite. The brand is a bit more expensive, but the quality and flavor make it totally worth it. I also really like that the company gives back to the community in so many ways.\n",

            "The flavor is great I love how theres a mixture of like cookie dough and Oreo in it. I love the size the only problem is is its so good where a lot of the times Ill eat the whole container in one sitting thats OK I wish they had bigger containers\n",
            "This is the best flavor of ice cream, hands down. It has the right balance of chocolate and vanilla ice cream and the brownie dough to cookie dough ratio is always perfect. I wish the pints were a little cheaper but love what the brand stands for\n",
            "Loooooved these when I was pregnant with my daughter !! Omg !! So good ! My sister would always buy it for me ! Love how crunchy the chocolate chips are when you bite into those cookie dough chunks ! Very delicious! I will be buying some today !\n",
            "My friend recommended this to me as its a classic fav but it was okay for me. I didnt like the too sugary pieces of the cookie dough. Im not a big fan of the cookie dough so wasnt a fan. These are pricey so I most likely wont buy this one again.\n",
            "Awesome! Never tried this classic until this week and it had the perfect amount of gobs and everything. Even if this ice cream melts and is refrozen - it still holds up much better than Phish food or other flavors that have lots of ingredients.\n",
            "My super sweet tooth cravings dream come true! Woo thats a mouthful! Half baked wont disappoint if you are looking for that super sweat treat to get you through your bad day, breakup, period, celebration! You name it this treats got you covered!\n",
            "This is one of my absolute favorite Ben & Jerry's flavors. Delicious creamy ice cream with precisely the right amount of mix-ins. Like with most B&J ice cream, I have to convince myself to not consume the entire pint. Strongly recommend to all!\n",
            "One of my fav flavors ever created. I can eat this anytime, winter/summer, afternoon/evening. It has big chunks of cookie dough and brownies in it. And Ben and Jerrys always has plenty of chunks. I will@most definitely be buying this one again.\n",
            "This is my favorite Ben and Jerry's. It is mixed with vanilla and chocolate ice cream, with chocolate chip cookie dough, and brownie batter. It is rich, but it is fantastic. It is also expensive considering that a pint is $5, but it is worth it\n",
            "The delicious, fat chunks of brownies with such rich (but not too heavy, as it should) chocolate ice cream pair oh so perfectly with the decadent vanilla and old school cookie dough! 10/10 everytime, my go to. If you want happy then this is it.\n",
            "This is the best ice cream! It is literally the best of every world. The vanilla ice cream with cookie dough is so good and the chocolate ice cream with brownie is delicious! It is a good price and I would definitely buy it again and recommend!\n",
            "This ice cream was my favorite when I was a teenage, its so good!!! I guess I kinda got tired of it though because I havent had it in so long lol! But now I kinda want some, so maybe Ill pick some up soon, and take a dive down memory lane lol!!\n",
            "I am obsessed with this ice cream. It has all of my favorite things inside so it's perfect. It's like going to Coldstone but without all the hasel and a better price! The only thing I dont like is I wish it had cake batter ice cream in it too!\n",
            "Ben & Jerrys Half Baked ice cream is seriously the best. This flavor combines two of my absolute favorite things brownie and cookie dough. It honestly doesnt get much better than that. This ice cream brand is a bit pricey, but its so worth it.\n",
            "Ben & Jerrys has been one of my favorite ice cream bands for years. I used to get it with my grandma walking along the beach. This half baked flavor is by far one of my favorites. I love the cookie dough and the brownie pieces that are inside.\n",
            "No matter what flavor I choose Ive never gone wrong with Ben and Jerrys. One of the best ice cream brands, Ill admit its a bit pricy for its small container but its overall worth it. You wouldnt be disappointed with any flavor from this brand.\n",
            "The best ice cream and flavour ever. If you're undecided between chocolate chip cookie dough and chocolate brownie this one is for you! I find other ice creams just don't compare to Ben and Jerry's. It is worth the extra price for the quality.\n",
            "This is one of the best ice cream that Ben and Jerrys makes. I would rate this 9 out of 10. This ice cream is delectable and creamy. Theres also pieces of brownie and cookie dough inside. It tastes so amazing. I recommend getting this product!\n",
            "This is by far my favorite ice cream! Its smooth and delicious and filled with cookie fought bites and my favorite part the half baked brownie bites all swirled together in creamy vanilla and chocolate ice cream. I recommend this to everyone.\n",
            "I love this flavor but recently purchased a pint and it was terrible, can't be sure if it was my local grocery stores fault or the batch was bad. Had a very odd texture it was similar to those dehydrated ice cream squares you get for camping.\n",
            "My weakness! I love this ice cream so much! There are so many different flavors and textures, making it a terrific, indulging dessert. Yes the perfect ice cream to eat when you’re bored and just want to sit in front of the tv and do nothing!\n",
            "If you havent had thisyou need it. This ice cream is packed with pieces of brownie and cookies. Unlike most ice cream, there arent many bites that dont have a huge amount of brownie/cookie dough. Well worth the few additional bucks you spend\n",
            "Best ice cream ever. Gives the best of both worlds- chocolate and brownies and vanilla and cookie dough. This is my favorite ice cream, plus I love the company so much. They are so socially responsible and help with so many important issues\n",
            "This is my sisters favorite ice cream! I think the flavor is very delicious and since Ben & Jerrys are known for their textures I wouldnt recommend if you dont really like textures in ice cream. Other than that this is an amazing ice cream!\n",
            "One of my absolute favorite ice cream flavors! Quality ice cream with flavorful, quality add-ins. The ice cream is packed full of the cookie dough & brownie. Ben & Jerrys may be more costly than other brands, but its definitely worth it\n",
            "I was chocked trying this ice cream. I had been sticking to the cookie dough flavor for years, which I still dearly enjoy, but when trying this one the cookie-dough got competition! I will definitely buy this one next time Im getting B&Js.\n",
            "This ice cream is seriously so flavorful and delicious, Im a true believer that no other ice cream brands compare to that of Ben and Jerrys because it is seriously THE BEST and the cookie dough chunks in here are HUGE and outta this world!\n",
            "Half baked is one of my favorite Ben and Jerrys ice cream flavors. It is a great go to for any audience or if you are in a hurry and you just want to grab one fast. I especially recommend purchasing it if you like cookie dough ice cream.\n",
            "Sooooooo good!! Loaded with chunks of brownies and cookie dough. Great consistency and phenomenal flavor. Not to mention Ben and Jerrys is a company with great values which makes me feel good about spending my money. You wont regret it!\n",
            "This is my second favorite Ben and Jerrys Ive cream. It has just the right amount of sweetness and is not over the top. I have easily eaten a whole pint in a single day. Overall, love this ice cream and the dairy they use is very creamy\n",

            "Ben & Jerrys Half Baked is my biggest weakness when it comes to ice cream. I wish I could say I had self control, but this pint...I can eat it all in one sitting. Everything inside it is so dang good and the ice cream is just so creamy.\n",
            "This ice cream is great there is so many flavor to choose from. The kids like to try the different mixes. Is a good quality ice cream for a decent price they even have froyo versions of some of their ice creams. Definitely worth a try.\n",
            "This ice cream is guaranteed to make your day better. The cookie dough chunks are amazing in this brand and really the reason I continue to buy the flavor. I love chocolate of course and I love the ice cream bar version on this flavor.\n",
            "Ugh where do i even begin?! This is one of my favorite ice cream flavors of all time. Each bite is packed with a different flavor that satisfies my palette. I will never grow tired of the taste of half baked ice cream from@ben & jerrys\n",
            "This is my go-to pint! Its got a little bit of everything! It is worth every penny to get a more expensive brand when the quality of the ice cream is so good! I would definitely recommend this brand to brownie and cookie dough lovers!\n",
            "If Im craving a little bit of everything, this is my go to choice. Delicious chocolate ice cream with bits of decadent brownies and cookie dough. I only eat a quarter of the paint because its too much sometimes, but overall delicious\n",
            "The best ice cream ever! Yes it is more expensive per pint than most ice creams are per quart but it is soooo good. I continue to buy this because I love the rich flavor and you cant beat a cookie dough and brownie combination to me!\n",

            "I love this ice cream. Havent had any in a couple of months. This is one of my favorite splurge ice cream choices. I like to get the small sized ones when I need an ice cream fix. Highly recommend to anyone, you should give it a try\n",
            "This is amazing. Perfect cravings ice cream. I love the size of the container and the ice cream is very creamy. Price is a little high but for the quality its worth it! Definitely will have these stocked in my freezer ! A must have.\n",
            "Its a perfect mix of vanilla and chocolate! Perfect when youre craving cookie dough & brownies!! Ben & Jerrys tend to be a little more on the expensive side but SO worth it! Especially since they pay their employees a livable wage!!\n",
            "I buy this all the time and it’s my favorite. Both brownies and chocolate chip cookies are my favorite sweets to eat. The fact that it’s in ice cream is even better because I get to enjoy the best of both worlds on hot summer days!\n",
            "Tried this ice cream because of all the great reviews but it was just too sweet for me. If you have a high tolerance for sugar like my boyfriend (who likes this brand) then you may enjoy this but to me it just tasted overly sugary.\n",
            "The best mixture of cookie dough and brownie. Its not the most expensive but it also isnt the cheapest but for the quality I would say its worth it! This is my go to ice cream I have it atleast once a week as a little weekend treat\n",

            "This ice cream is a bit too rich for me. I love the vanilla ice cream with the brownies and the cookie dough, that's the really good portion. The chocolate ice cream is very strong, and too overwhelming to combine nicely with this.\n",
            "Can you say delicious??? Growing up in Maine I was able to enjoy fresh Ben & Jerry's ice cream at out local beaches. The way they make their pints is so amazing and just like the fresh ice cream you get. This flavor is so so yummy.\n",
            "Probably the best ice cream that exists. Its a great price for a pint and is packed full of flavor. Its better than others that are similar because you get a chunk of dough in just about every single bite. Overall its a top choice.\n",
            "This is my favorite!! One of my pregnancy cravings so Ive been going through a lot of it lately. Its so delicious. I dont care if its pricey because Its worth it to me! [product:ben-&-jerrys-ice-cream-half-baked-16oz] #goodbyejuly\n",

            "This tastes very good but is a little but to chocolatey for my taste. I love how they are in small containers so I dont even have to grab a bowl! I wish there was more cookie dough in it though! I recommend if you love chocolate\n",
            "I love the combination of The vanilla and chelate with the brownie and cookie dough bits...that are perfectly soft! I will forever love this slightly over price ice cream brand! And I love what the company stands for in general!\n",

            "This ice cream is so good, and I didnt think I would like it. I dont love chocolate ice cream, but with the mix of chocolate and vanilla with cookie dough and brownie bites it is delicious. We keep buying it again and again!!!\n",
            "Its really hard for me to pick a favorite Ben & Jerrys, but this is absolutely a top contender. How can you improve upon brownies AND ice cream in one pint? I love how both are perfectly chewy and balance the creamy ice cream.\n",

            "I LOVE this ice cream. I always go back to this one. I have tried other Ben & Jerrys ice cream but this by far is the best one. Although the Cherry Garcia is pretty amazing as well! But you can never go wrong with Half Baked\n",

            "Love this flavor and decided to try in my cheesecakes will let you know how it turns out.\n",
            "i really like all the flavors in the icecream it was really good and left me wanting more\n",

            "This ice cream is the bomb! It has brownies and cookie dough!!! What more can you ask for\n",
            "What could be better than ice cream loaded with cookie dough AND brownies?! Super delish!\n",
            "Wish I could give it 6 stars! This ice cream stays in my freezer! I’m completely obsessed\n",
            "One of my FAV flavors! A great mix of ALL the good! If you havent tried this you need to!\n",
            "This is one of my most favorite Ice creams! The amount of cookie dough in it is amazing.\n",
            "This is my number one favorite ice cream brand and I wouldnt even want any other flavor!\n",
            "I dont think Ben and Jerrys have ever created a bad flavor. Always so amazing and creamy\n",
            "Its good , not the best, its affordable and if your into trying new things you would buy\n",
            "This is so yummy I love this flavor so good I can eat this all day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
            "I love it. Its one of my favorite flavors because it has a few different things in there\n",
            "Hands down the best ice cream ever really rich creamy flavor . Really affordable price.\n",
            "Love cookie dough and I love Ben and Jerrys so yay! Plenty of cookie dough bits inside.\n",
            "Love the crispy chocolate shell, creamy love the chocolate pieces inside the ice cream.\n",
            "The best icecream I have ever eaton.So delicious. Definitely my go to comfort food :-)\n",
            "Im not even a huge ice cream fan this is one of my absolute favorites! One of my go tos\n",
            "Omg the best. Cant live without it. Of you havent tried this youre totally missing out.\n",
            "Too sweet to my taste to be honest. I prefer their strawberry cheesecake flavor better\n",
            "LOVEEE IT!!! Too fave is always half baked. Delicious isnt even the word. Its the best\n",
            "Considering the fact that chocolate ice cream isn’t my favorite, the ratio was unequal\n",
            "Hands down the best ice cream I ever tried. Half baked is by far my favorite ever!!!!!\n",
            "Amazing. 10/10. Would consume. Not my favorite but my backup. Who doesnt love cookies.\n",
            "By far the most addicting flavor EVER I love this brand and everything they stand for!\n",
            "Errr mah gerrrd! One of the best ice creams! Wish they made bigger containers though.\n",
            "Great for when you cant decide if you want cookies or ice cream because you get both!\n",
            "Its my favorite ice cream in ze game! A mixture of cookies and brownies, count me in.\n",
            "Half Baked ice cream, yes!!! It’s amazing and I would recommend everyone to try it!!!\n",
            "Hubby loved cookie dough. This is one of his favorites. Easy to find and great price\n",
            "Every time I get Ben and Jerry’s I cream this is what I get(* get ice cream a lot).\n",
            "It is UNREAL..... Legit heavenly. Get your hands on this dank cream yall. For real.\n",
            "My absolute favorite ice cream ever! Cookie dough and brownies mixed! Soooo good!\n",
            "By far my fav ice cream when I'm literally baked please don't get rid of it EVER\n",
            "Fudge brownie basically overpowered all of the other ingredients in the flavor.\n",
            "My fav ice cream ever. I could eat it any time. It's usually my midnight snack.\n",
            "I have to admit it. This is the only flavor I buy. It is the best treat ever!\n",
            "legiterally saved my fudging liiiiifeee, and id eat 10 pints if i could\n",
            "The BEST - a lot of pieces in a mixture and rich in different flavours.\n",
            "This has always been my favorite flavor! Never fails to be delicious.\n",
            "Barely anything but vanilla and chocolate ice cream very displeased.\n",
            "i buy this stuff all the time so i can gain some weight it’s insane\n",
            "I love this flavor. It is my default when I can’t make up my mind.\n",
            "Best of both worlds, chocolate & vanilla, cookie dough and brownie\n",
            "Go to ice cream when I’m sad is absolutely the best ice cream ever\n",
            "Very good flavored. I am 32 character short so here are some more.\n",
            "This ice cream is my favorite Ben and Jerry’s ice cream flavor!!!\n",
            "This is my absolute favourite icecream. It makes me super happy.\n",
            "wish there were larger size options and cake optionj\n",
            "This flavor got me through a baaaaad break up yall.\n",
            "Everyone who thinks its lower than a 5 is WRONG!!!\n",
            "Lots of flavor too good to not go back for more...\n",
            "enough said...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
            "And don't buy them ever again. It's a waste of your money. Because Ben and Jerry have finally made the best cookies n cream and brought it too the masses. Instead of vanilla icecream with a cookie crumb every now and then, it's jam packed with cookies. It's everything cookies n cream fans have always wanted.\n",
            "I bought this at my local Walmart last week and was blown away. Finished the pint in 2 days. I went back to the store multiple times, couldn't find it. I've called many other Walmarts. They were all out too. Grab this one while you can! Get two or three even!\n",
            "Ben & Jerry's has reinvented my favorite basic ice cream flavor, Cookies and Cream. This should just replace all Cookies and Cream flavors everywhere and be the new standard for what is Cookies and Cream. Finally, someone actually put enough cookies in the ice cream. Usually, Cookies and Cream tastes like vanilla ice cream with the ocasional taste of cookie. This seems to be the other way around and I love it. Big cookie pieces! I hope this flavor never goes away.\n",
            "Attn:: So my 6 year old saw this flavor and asked me to buy it, i did. He eats the carton within 2 days saying it was the best he ever tasted, super rare for him to devour ice cream that fast.. Beggs for another carton, I carry on and I go buy another carton for him. Later on my hubby is making a cup for my son and he randomly tasted it. Came to me like babe thats the best cookie and cream ice cream i ever had, ranting and raving... So me going to being nosey in the middle of the night i secures a cup. WHOOOOAAAAA! Blown away with its deliciousness. Needless to say i have to go to the store tomorrow to replace my sons carton LOL. We are all addicted. BNJ PUHHHHLEEEEASEEEE DO NOT GET RID OF THIS FLAVOR! I see those limited edition wrappings! Please don't do it. LOL. Sincerely The Late Night Snackin Mom\n",
            "I picked this up with the Red, White and blueberry shortbread and the The Sweet like sugar new flavor as well a few days ago. And have to say that I was not disappointed at all. I know this is more of a tamer flavor for the company. But I can't help but feel that is what makes this flavor the best. Because there are so many cookies and cream variations out there, that don't always taste the best. And this one definitely does not disappoint with this shopper. Keep it up.\n",
            "So another brand use to have Ice Cream Sandwich ice cream but they stopped selling it and all this year I have been searching. Alas, here comes B&J to save the day. I absolutely love and have bought like 3 -4 cartons of it since it's come out. Cookies and Cream but amplified!! If you guys bring out Superman ice cream I know that B&J pays attention to their customer base!!\n",
            "I ate an entire pint in one day and now I can’t find it anywhere!! It’s soo good!\n",
            "I am a cookies and cream connoisseur when it comes to ice cream. This by far what is the best cookies and cream I’ve ever had. The right amount of cookies and vanilla and goodness wrapped into one beautiful pint! Please please please do not stop making this and please have it at more stores because I can only get it at one.\n",
            "I have been waiting for YEARS for Ben and Jerry's to come out with this flavor! It's so amazing! Just letting you know, if you get rid of this flavor after completing said life, I will never buy your ice cream again! Lol\n",
            "I got the last one at the grocery store and it’s absolutely delicious. Never stop making this flavor!\n",
            "I can’t even begin to describe to you how good this is. Forget about all other cookies and cream ice creams. You don’t need other ones anymore. THIS is everything cookies and cream should be. It’s so riddled with cookie crumbs and big cookie chunks it’s a cookie dream come true. You won’t be disappointed with this one! Excellent job Ben & Jerry’s! Never stop making this!\n",
            "I have been looking for this flavor ever since I heard of its release. I’m a lover of all things cookies and cream and this icecream didn’t disappoint. I hope that this becomes a permanent flavor because it is now my favorite flavor. The flavors are intense and the cookie flavor is so yummy. Please please don’t take this flavor away. The is only one store in my area that carries it so I buy it in threes with no shame. Sooooo freaking good!\n",
            "I picked this up last week at Walmart and I’m glad I did. The best cookies and cream ice cream I’ve ever had. For some reason I wasn’t expecting as good as it was and it blew me away. Hopefully this one never goes away! Definitely pick it up if you’re at a Wal-Mart\n",
            "My husband and I could eat this by the gallon if it were available. We can’t even share a pint and always have to buy one each. I can only hope that this flavor becomes widespread and never leaves the line up! We are addicted! :)\n",
            "Bought this yesterday and I was not disappointed. As an avid Cookies & Cream eater, this looked enticing, but it was SOOO much better than expected. PLEASE do not get rid of this one ever!!!\n",
            "I brought ice cream Sammie today and let me tell you it’s so good I love it great Job Ben n jerry it is my new favorite definely recommend.\n",
            "Saw a new product and it was somewhat similar to sweet cream and cookies which i needed to try. It was amazing!!!!!!\n",
            "I can't get enough of this ice cream I buy one every time I got to the store and the name has a bit of meaning to me\n",
            "Way to go Ben & Jerry’s!! This is the best cookies & cream ice cream!!! Please make it a regular flavor!!\n",
            "Best cookies and cream ice cream I’ve ever had. I hope they make a non-dairy version\n",
            "I loved the old Vermonty Python ice cream by Ben + Jerry because of the delicious cookie swirl but then they discontinued it. THEN, I liked milk and cookies only for the cookie swirl and would eat around the ice cream just looking for the swirls as the rest was too sweet. NOW this has CHANGED MY ICE CREAM LIFE! Cookie ice cream with cookie swirls, holy moly I am so excited about this. Best B+J ice cream YET. Please keep this one forever!\n",
            "This ice cream was pretty good, had a nice combo of flavor and a good balance of chocolate.\n",
            "I’m in love with this ice cream. Ben & Jerry’s is the only ice cream brand that I eat, so I’ve been slowly trying my hand at different flavors. The Tonight Dough, Americone Dream, and Half Baked used to be in a tie for my favorite until I had this. It’s like your classic cookies and cream but BETTER. And I love ice cream sandwiches so that, to me, is the best part. It’s so delicious!\n",
            "This is legit the best cookies and cream ice cream. Probably one of the best pints of ice cream out there.\n",
            "I’ve never written a review before, but I had to after eating this. It combines my two favorite things in the world (ice cream sandwiches and sandwich cookies) and jam packs them into a perfect pint. Every spoon has so much of both so you’re never left digging around to get more cookie. PLEASE never stop making this flavor!!\n",
            "Ben & Jerry’s continues to be my emotional support during this crazy pandemic. This flavor is 1 of 7 pints purchased. I can’t wait to try the other 3 new flavors. Thanks B&J! Also, love this companies stance fondness for equality and justice for all.\n",
            "Best cookies and cream ice cream I’ve had. Does it tastes like a classic ice cream sandwich? Maybe a little/not really? It really doesn’t matter to me. 5/5\n",
            "Eating this i never thought of an ice cream sandwich but i did feel i was eating the best cookies and cream ever!!!\n",
            "If you’re a cookies n cream lover, this pint is for you! This is your “life” ice cream! Love this flavor!\n",
            "I saw this at my local Walmart and had to try it. Very good Ben&Jerry!! This is my new fave!\n",
            "I love cookies and cream and this is even better! Yum!\n",
            "I have bought it twice and I’m happy I’m buying it\n",
            "I've been buying Milk & Cookies for i don't even know how long. I have to drive 30 minutes total just to go get it because none of my local stores have it. It's officially ruined all other cookies & cream flavored ice creams for me, nothing can top it. I mean, it't got TWO kinds of cookies in it. What??? Man that's a lot of cookie. And you know, every time I buy a pint, I always think \"man, is this $4-something-or-other worth it for just one pint?\" and every time I get a different brand's cookies and cream flavor I always get my answer. It's absolutely worth it. This will be served at my wedding, and most certainly at my funeral. If anyone comes up to me and tries to convince me there's a better flavor out there, they can expect nothing less than a full on war.\n",
            "I recently came across the Milk&Cookies flavor at my local convenient store and...WOW! If Oreo, Chips Ahoy, Tate's, Milano, and Nutella came together to make the best flavor of ice cream ever, it would not even come close to Milk&Cookies. The only problem is that I am becoming addicted and it is starting to affect my social life. Although my girlfriend dumped me and my friends no longer want to spend time with me, I will never stop eating Milk&Cookies Ice Cream. I am willing to take out a mortgage in order to purchase Milk&Cookie Ice Cream in larger quantities. Thank you Ben. Thank you Jerry.\n",
            "This is just what I was hoping for tonight. I love Ben and Jerry’s chocolatey, caramely, marshmallowy gooie flavors the most but tonight I wanted something different. I wanted exactly what Milk and Cookies delivered; a delicious vanilla ice cream with cookie swirls. No fudge chunks or nuts or oozey mix ins this time (even though that’s my favorite). Just a perfect ‘dry’ blend of cookie swirls and excellent vanilla ice cream. I will get this one every time I need a break from the Phish Food, Karamel Sutra and peanut butter fudge cores of the world. Awesome flavor!\n",
            "I was going to give it 5-stars, because it's BY FAR the best ice cream flavor that I've ever tasted! However, Milk & Cookies isn't available in a lot of stores, so it's definitely a challenge to find sometimes. Our local Whole Foods is really the only place that carries it. But, if you can find it, TRY IT! You won't be disappointed!\n",
            "I've been buying Ben & Jerry's for ages now, but I've never really been consistent with a certain flavor. I've always kept buying new ones to try. I'm on vacation in Florida, and found the Milk & Cookies one in the local grocery store and HAD to try it. Needless to say, we went back and grabbed 3 more the next day!\n",
            "I tried this flavor once because they were out of my past fav- Cookie Dough. This one is a million times better! The cookies are amazing. The ice cream is amazing. Everything together is awesome. Thank you Ben and Jerry's for an awesome flavor. I could eat 20 pints of this.\n",
            "I am the lady who will buy up the whole store if I see cookies & milk B&J ice cream on the shelf. I ate 2 pints in one day once! It all started, they were out of cookie dough (my old favorite) so decided to try the next best cookie thing on the shelf. Boy was I GLAD I did. It became my new favorite INSTANTLY. It’s so good though I have to really warm folks that you may NEVER want another flavor again. That’s what’s happened to me going on 3 years now since discovering it. My only problem with it is I’m mad I didn’t find out about it sooner!! I LOVE EVERY BUT ABOUT! 100 thumbs up!!! MMMMMM\n",
            "LOVE THIS ICE CREAM! Its the perfect combination.!! Thank you Ben & Jerrys\n",
            "Every time I get ice cream this is the flavor I reach for, some people think it's a boring flavor but that is in no way accurate. It combines my favorite flavors, cookie dough and cookie's & cream creating the ultimate ice cream. With no overpowering crazy flavors, it took classic flavors and made them better. Ice cream will truly never taste the same - big shoutout to both Ben and Jerry for this one. (also it's a great post-run dessert)\n",
            "I had always been strictly Half Baked or Americone Dream, until I tried Milk & Cookies when all others were sold out. Needless to say I found a new reigning favorite. Nothing can compare to the gooey-ness of the cookie swirls - NOTHING. I fell very strongly about this ice cream flavor and I will defend its title as the best Ben & Jerry’s flavor.\n",
            "I’m not the type of person to sit and eat a bowl of ice cream but with this flavor I can eat a whole pint, it the best ice cream flavor I have ever had, my boyfriend and I have to drive 30 min away just to buy it because no local stores carry it.. My boyfriend is an ice cream lover and he even says this is the best ice cream ever.\n",
            "I ordered an unspecified pint of Ben & Jerry's from the deli and my delivery guy gave me this gem. I fell in love. It was fate <3\n",
            "I love Ben and Jerry’s and I have for a LONG time. Over the last several months, I’ve decided to spoon my way through every flavor I can get in my area or online and last night was Milk and Cookies. It was definitely yummy but not my favorite. The cookie swirls were GREAT! The vanilla ice cream was for some reason not my favorite. I think a chocolate milk and cookies would be better. And I love Ben and Jerry’s vanilla a lot. All in all, this was a good pint but I like a lot of other flavors more.\n",
            "My husband and I have a pint B&Js probably every 3 days. This one is such a hit! We love Half Baked but this one is like a soft cookie sundae. My favorite is getting those little chocolate chips in the mix, it just adds another layer of something already fantastic. It would be dope if there were full sized mini chocolate chips instead of the micro ones. Either way, great flippin' ice cream!\n",
            "I have a deep and intense love for this ice cream. If I could marry it, I would. B&Js best ice cream flavor by a long shot, and they never skimp on the fix ins. All my friends write it off as just a regular cookies and cream ice cream but NO! This is so much more than that. I would like to be buried in a coffin shaped like a B&Js pint of Milk & Cookies ice cream. That is all.\n",
            "I found myself wanting ice cream one day and I found this flavor in one of my local stores. I thought it would be strange with 2 different cookies , boy was I wrong ! Definetly one of my favorites of not my top favorite. Besides who's not in the mood for milk and cookies !?! You'd just be crazy if you said you weren't. HIGHLY suggest this flavor you will not regret it !\n",
            "I have been getting milk & cookies for years now and when I run out, I HAVE to restock. I don’t normally even have a sweet tooth, but there’s just something about the texture and taste of the cookies mixed with this ice cream! Milk & Cookies is my all time favorite ice cream and I always make my friends try it. You should too!\n",
            "This is literally the best ice cream flavor I have ever had! I'm actually eating it as I write this review. I just have one suggestion for the recipe...ADD MORE CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES!!!! This is a 10/10 ice cream flavor, but it would be a 20/10 if there were more chocolate chip cookie chunks in it!\n",
            "Quite possibly the most accurate name for an ice cream flavor. Tastes exactly like cookies dipped in milk. The vanilla base is appropriately subtle enough to let the cookies shine, while adding the creaminess when melting. If there is one flaw, it's in the chocolate chocolate chip cookies which strangely taste a bit fruity. But that might just be me. Great flavor regardless.\n",
            "This is my favorite flavor. I get it anytime I am able! I love the swirls of cookie and the huge chunks of cookie that you get mixed in. I don't like cookie dough in ice-cream, so this works superbly. I love that it includes both chocolate cookies and chocolate chip cookies.\n",
            "My favorite flavor changes every year or so. Milk & Cookies is this years. What's the point of buying boring cookie dough flavor when this is available? The cookie swirl works so well and is such a great addition to the TWO kinds of cookie dough in this delicious blend.\n",
            "This is the best ice cream I have ever had in my life. This ice cream makes me feel like I’m ten again and its the year 2000. The flavor is comparable to:\n",
            "- Receiving a surprise puppy.\n",
            "- Playing man-hunt outside with your friends in the middle of the summer.\n",
            "- The feeling you get when you can finally click “skip ad” on Pandora and YouTube.\n",
            "I have not bought another ice cream in years. This is the best ice cream available in a pint that I have ever had. I have not even gotten sick of this ice cream. The two types of cookies (especially the light one) is absolutely delicious!\n",
            "I picked up my first pint of Milk & Cookies a few years ago during a particularly hard time in my life. It was like a soothing balm during my emotional crisis. Could it be because it brings back a sense memory of better childhood times? Possibly. Or could it be because it is so darn tasty. I'm going with the latter. I have to really search my local stores for it and in the rare moments when they do have this flavor I buy multiple pints at once and look like a crazy woman. Thanks B&J. Thank you.\n",
            "Recently I went to a store that didn't have any of my usual favorites, so I grabbed this one just to see what it was like. I know I love cookies, and cookie sundaes so I would probably like it. I'm not a fan of cookie dough ice cream (I like it plain, but not in my ice cream), so I was glad it was regular cookie pieces. It was amazing! I love the chocolate cookie swirls and the chocolate chip cookie pieces. It's only sold at certain stores, so that's the only downside, but it's a new favorite.\n",
            "I bought this for the first time the other day and boy was I in for it. I used to get the fudge brownie but they were always skimpin on the brownie bits. And now here I am, writing a review about ice cream!!!!!\n",
            "Milk & Cookies is in my top five of favorites from Ben & Jerry’s. The marrying of high quality vanilla ice cream and three types of cookies is a delectable treat sure to satisfy anyone’s sweet tooth.\n",
            "Milk & Cookies is the best ice cream flavor you will ever buy. I could eat pints and pints of this. You HAVE to try it! HIGHLY recommend!!!\n",
            "The Tonight Dough was previously my favorite, but Milk and Cookies tops the charts! I could eat a scoop or two every day!\n",
            "This ice cream is one of my favorite bnj flavors. I would describe it as a mix of cookie dough and cookies and cream.\n",
            "I once drove almost two hours for a pint of milk and cookies because the grocery store was out of it. Enough said.\n",
            "This is one my wife just cannot pass up! Thank you Ben & Jerry for this wonderful get out of jail free card.\n",
            "BEST ice cream in the universe. Never buying anything else.\n",
            "I’m a happy huge cookie fan so this ice cream is amazing!\n",
            "I remember the first time I bought Milk and Cookies on a whim, and I consumed that first pint within minutes.\n",
            "I buy this flavor every time I go to the store but it was sold out for almost a month I legit went everyday to see if they had gotten milk & cookies and I left with a sad face. I even went to another store, and guess what?? They didn't have it either I went to 3 other stores and nope nope and nope but finally the other day boom they had it ugh I'm enjoying some now as I write ugh I'm in love..... the best\n",
            "Ever since I found this flavor it is the only flavor I will buy. It is the perfect combination of different cookies and only has vanilla ice cream which is different from most flavors and that is a big pro in my eyes. Hands down the best Ben & Jerry’s flavor ever and even though it’s hard for me to find sometimes it is always worth it! Definitely worth straying from your go-to flavor to try this one out!\n",
            "This is my absolute favorite flavor of ice cream. Taking the spot from the former champion, green mint chocolate chip, this is the best ice cream I have ever put in my mouth. When I ended a long term relationship and was feeling a bit down, my roommate and her boyfriend went to 6 stores to fine one of these to bring to me. It was the b st cure for a broken heart I ever had.\n",
            "I’ve had this flavor before and it was delicious but recently I purchased it again and it wasn’t great. My favorite part of this ice cream is the chocolate cookie swirl and unfortunately there was barely any in this pint! The cookie swirl was only in about a quarter of the pint and the rest was the vanilla ice cream with barely any cookie pieces! Very disappointing\n",
            "I have always loved milk and cookies and buy it ALL the time. Recently I have noticed a dramatic decrease in the amount of cookie in the container, it’s mostly just plain vanilla icecream. Very disappointed.. for the top of the line ice cream at almost $6 a pint this is unacceptable.\n",
            "Eating a pint of this ice cream is more satisfying than having actual milk and cookies. This is the best flavor, and yes this is the hill I've chosen to die on. The ice cream is loaded with delicious cookies and chocolate swirls. The milky flavor penetrates the cookies themselves. I hope this flavor is never discontinued because I'd be beyond upset.\n",
            "Cookies n cream is an old time favorite for a lot of people me included, and it's not easy to make a simple, old time favorite even better, but Ben and Jerry's managed to do just that. They don't skimp on the cookie mix ins, and I haven't seen any other cookies n cream ice cream like this one. This is one of my top three flavors.\n",
            "I love this flavor! It is what cookies and cream should taste like, but seldom does. It is grounded in Ben & Jerry's awesome vanilla with just the right amount of intense chocolate cookie flavor. Honestly, it is hard to describe why this ice cream is so delicious. It just Is! This flavor surpassed my expectations.\n",
            "When I tried this ice cream fro the first time my life changed. No flavor can ever live up to it. I feel like a kid again when I eat this ice cream. It seems to not be stocked at most places which is so frustrating and the only downside to this flavor. Try this asap and you'llnever go back to any other flavor.\n",
            "I used to eat Half Baked, but the grocery store I was at was out....So I picked this up. This is the best Ice Cream I have ever had!!!! I est cookies and ice cream often because it is my favorite dessert but this is just amazing!!! Now my dad loves it. Too bad they dont sell it at any of the walmarts near me.\n",
            "The only reasoning I have to be disappointed is the fact that I didn't try this flavor sooner!! It is chocked full of cookie bits and has become my new favorite. I can only hope they make this vegan by the time I transition back or I'll be pining for it. For now, I'll be enjoying whenever possible.\n",
            "It taste great not too sweet (other B&J are too sweet for me) taste even better than haagen dazs's cookie and cream, but i am disappointed that the ingredients have:\n",
            "CANOLA OIL, SOYBEAN OIL, BUTTEROIL, TAPIOCA STARCH, GUAR GUM & CARRAGEENAN.\n",
            "i am not sure if i will buy again.\n",
            "I bought this flavor for a change and it pleasantly surprised me. It is a great option for cookie lovers. I'm more of a peanut butter cup girl myself, but this flavor did not disappoint. The only thing I would have changed would be to add more Chunks of chocolate chip cookie!\n",
            "Tastes exactly like cookies and milk! Really good. I wish the cookies were a bit more like cookie dough, but overall it's a very good flavor.\n",
            "I decided to pick this ice cream flavor for my first time trying Ben and Jerry's because of all the good reviews associated with it but I was extremely disappointed. The flavor was too bland for my taste. I don't think I will be buying this again in the near future.\n",
            "I usually do half baked but decided to try Milk & Cookies a try. It is DEFINITELY a game changer - I'm never buying anything else. I've been talking about it nonstop at work and to my friends. I gave one of my friends some to try and they were obsessed too!\n",
            "The ice cream and cookie chunks were fantastic, but there was a big air socket in the bottom of my pint which resulted in ~30% of the ice cream being left missing. Great ice cream otherwise, but will have to subtract a star for the missing ice cream :(\n",
            "This is hands down my favorite flavor. It has the perfect balance of vanilla and chocolate, the perfect texture balance between soft cookie dough & crunchy chocolate chips. This is my go to after a long week and will forever be my first choice.\n",
            "I cannot get enough of this ice cream flavor! Between the \"Oreo\" and chocolate chip cookie each bite is delicious. I go through at least one a week and am fortunate the corner store stocks this flavor. I hope they never get rid of this!\n",
            "I've recommended this flavor to several of my friends now, and they've all become obsessed with it. You should make a dairy free version of this flavor, because everyone needs to be able to enjoy this Mona Lisa of the frozen dessert world.\n",
            "Obsessed! This is the perfect blend of ingredients in 1 pint! Perfect chocolate cookie w vanilla ice cream and fudge swirls! Perfect balance! Always sells out at my grocery local grocery stores! Please never stop making this!!!\n",
            "This is one of my favorite ben and jerry's flavor ever! The cookies just melt in my mouth and it takes me back to my childhood of when I dipped my cookies in milk. Hands down, one of the best flavors ever. I love it so much!!!\n",
            "Seriously, it's THAT good. Just a perfect swirl or crunchy chocolatey cookie ribbon, chocolate chip cookies, and vanilla ice cream. I eat pints several days in a row. I absolutely LOVE this ice cream. It is my #1 fave ever!\n",
            "this is my favorite ice cream flavor. Me and my bff sam Stan mink and cookies. We highly recommend for anything from a brake ups to celebrating amazing achievements to just treating yourself. MILK AND COOKIES IS THE BOMB!!!\n",
            "Milk and Cookies is by far my favorite flavor B & J have out right now. (My all time faves are retired :(...) It brings the best of cookies&cream and choc chip cookie dough into one fabulous pint. Go find one now!!\n",
            "This flavor is so good, I have the worst guilt every time I eat it. If there's a way to get a lifetime supply of it, I am highly interested, so that if I ever become homeless, I'd have the ice cream to fall back on\n",
            "I’ve been buying this nonstop ever since I tried it 3 months ago. I’m always upset when they’ve ran out at my local grocery store, however I’m in love with the crunchiness, the creaminess and how yummy it is.\n",
            "I LOVE LOVE LOVE this flavor. When ever I venture out and try a new flavor, I always also buy this as my backup plan. I just cant let it go! It's so good!!! Thank you Ben & Jerrys! Please never ever go!\n",
            "During my pregnancy I craved ice cream almost every day. My husband knows how much I love cookies and so he brought this flavor home one evening. I have been absolutely OBSESSED ever since!!!\n",
            "As much as I looooooove this ice cream as a cookies and cream addict, could it be possible to turn this flavor into a nondairy pint? I would die of happiness and not lactose intolerance lol\n",
            "Almost got this one right. I never dunked my cookies in vanilla flavored milk when I was a kid. I think a simple sweet cream/no flavor ice cream would have been closer to the real thing.\n",
            "I think this is my favorite ben and jerrys at the moment. I love pretty much any with the chocolate cookie mixed in. I agree with some others, I wish it were carried in more stores.\n",
            "I don't like milk but I love this milk and cookies! It has real cookies infused with the ice cream giving you a taste of heaven. I love this flavor. Easily anyone's top 5 ice cream.\n",
            "I really love this flavor but I have to pick out the Chocolate Chocolate Chip cookie pieces. Tastes soooooo gross! Almost manly. Like an old mans cologne. Very strange.\n",
            "I absolutely love this ice cream. I always try new flavors, but I always grab this one as well. The easiest way to my heart, is with a pint of milk and cookies.\n",
            "Milk and Cookies is not just Ben & Jerry's best flavor it is the best ice cream EVER!!! It is my go to ice cream now. Never go without a pint in my freezer.\n",
            "This ice cream has no mix-ins, only swirls, but it's so loaded with cookie swirls that it's delicious! This is easily one of Ben and jerry's best flavors!\n",
            "i discovered this flavor at a gas station an hour away from me and i got hooked. 10/10 WOULD RECOMMEND. me and my sister finished 4 pints in a day.\n",
            "Everytime I see a Ben and Herry’s this is my go to choice whenever I don’t feel like risk it! Love the cookies, love the flavour!!! ♥️ Super yummy!\n",
            "Honestly how can you go wrong? It’s like the perfect mushy milk-dunked homemade cookie BUT ICE CREAM?! Genius. Move over classic cookie dough.\n",
            "I love me some Ben and Jerry’s, but this flavor takes the cake (haha, dessert joke) because it is new and improved cookies and cream. So good.\n",
            "This flavor has been my favorite for the past couple of years! Sometimes I would switch to other B&J flavors but soon I would be back to it!\n",
            "After not being able to find boom chocolata anymore, i tried this wonderful flavor since it seemed closest. So good. Never disappoints.\n",
            "Tastes just like milk and cookies, there are multiple types of cookies, and it brings me back to childhood memories, A+\n",
            "This is the best ice cream I ever had in my whole life. It was so good I took time out of my day to write this review.\n",
            "I always look for this flavor in target. I can finish the whole pint in one sitting and I only feel half guilty:)))))\n",
            "I have been a fan ever since the flavor appeared. I share my love for milk and cookies with all whom I come across.\n",
            "Best ice cream flavor EVER, hands down. Flavor is spot on with its name. Tastes just like milk and fresh cookies.\n",
            "Has the perfect balance between chocolate cookies and vanilla ice cream... I can pay any price for this....\n",
            "This is my go to when I get Ben & Jerry’s ice cream it’s now my new favorite or at least one of them\n",
            "The crunchy oreos are amazing! I just ate a whole pint myself sooo worth the calories. just wow\n",
            "This is my favorite ice cream ever. Although, the only place that sells it is 45 minutes away.\n",
            "There I said it. I am an ice cream connoisseur. There is none better (mass produced, that is).\n",
            "This is my favorite ice cream flavor of all time! Tastes like an ice cream cookie sandwich\n",
            "What a great flavor! It has that great cookie crumble that I love + cookie dough...mmmm!\n",
            "This ice cream never lets me down. The flavor tastes just like my grandmothers cookies.\n",
            "My favorite ice cream of all time! Honestly it's like cookie dough ice cream on crack.\n",
            "One of my favorites so good! I love the chocolate chip cookie ingredient vs oreos!\n",
            "I have found ice cream peace. How is it im just trying now? This stuff is AMAZING.\n",
            "Obsessed! My absolute favorite flavor by Ben and jerry and I have tried a ton!\n",
            "Definitely the best ben & jerry’s I’ve had. Really good taste and combination\n",
            "I was very disappointed in this flavor. I couldn’t even finish the tub. :(\n",
            "It’s been my favorite for a long time. It’s extremely mouth watering\n",
            "I'm hooked on this flavor.... just tried it a week ago!!!!\n",
            "Looooooove this flavor its one of the best I have ever had\n",
            "Always my go to! Can't find any ice cream that's better!\n",
            "I buy this ice cream every Thursday. It is the best.\n",
            "The best flavor hands down! This is my go to flavor.\n",
            "Yea...............................................\n",
            "This is my favorite Icecream in the whole wide world. POINT BLANK PERIOD. I drive 5 miles to the closest store that carries it atleast 1 a week which is a good thing as if it were closer is probably eat it everyday. Amazing job on this one guys!\n",
            "It's been a while since I've bought this ice cream because I can't find it in my local grocery store but I love this flavor so much! I ate two pints in one sitting! My doctor says I need to stop buying Ben and Jerrys because of my diabetes but I can't stop! Aaahhh! I love this ice cream so much that I have to sneak it in the house because my family tries to hide it from me. I've stopped eating regular food and I basically just eat ice cream every meal. This has to be one of my favorite flavors after half baked! Thank you for your service, Ben and Jerry!\n",
            "Literally my favorite ice cream out of all of the ice cream I've eaten in the world. Sometimes it's hard to find at certain stores, but I'll climb through a freezer door to search for it. #NoShame\n",
            "This is my go to flavor whenever I buy Ben & Jerrys! I love how big the chocolate cookie chunks are!\n",
            "This has always been my favorite but the last 3 pints I have bought have had almost no chocolate cookie chunks! This is very upsetting as this is my favorite ice cream and my favorite park is the cookie chunks. I instead have been left with mint ice cream with a few spattering of what looks like cookie crumbs. For the high price of B&Js I expected more.\n",
            "I really like this flavor, it is super awesome! For real, my favorite.\n",
            "I like big chunks of cookie & I cannot lie. Unlike the cookie dust that's typical of most cookies & cream, my pint had about three quarter cookie sized pieces & many more respectable sized chunks besides. & of course chocolate & mint play nice together.\n",
            "Me and this flavor have been going strong for 10+ years in fact it’s been my “gateway” flavor which lured me into supporting this company and branching out to find new flavors I love (such as justice remix, oatmeal cookie etc..) it’s super refreshing with thick Oreo pieces and doesn’t have that weird green color other companies add\n",
            "As a chunk fan who loves half baked, I recently decided to stop loyally buying my pints of Half Baked and gave this flavor a try. I read it was supposed to have big, generous sized cookie pieces all throughout the pint. Well, my pint didn't have a single big cookie chunk! It was just very small crumbles and mainly mint ice cream. I'm so disappointed! I was expecting this to be the ultimate ice cream for chunk lovers based on what I heard. :(\n",
            "I was so excited to finally try the Mint Chocolate Cookie ice cream. I'm a huge mint chocolate chip fan, mint ice cream fan in general. But with the concoctions that B&J puts together to make some of the best ice cream flavors around, this flavor is disappointing. I would have expected chocolate chunks, swirls of chocolate, or even the Andes mint chocolates that are sold in stores. But this is basically cookies n cream ice cream with mint flavor. The ice cream isn't even green. Yes it's still yummy, but doesn't live up to what Ben & Jerry's is capable of throwing together.\n",
            "I bought this flavor yesterday at Walgreens for $6.94 and I must say this flavor is ADDICTING! It’s so good. Ben & Jerry’s knows the perfect balance. The mint flavor is clean and authentic and not sickeningly sweet and artificial and it’s not green like most mint ice creams. Plus, the cookies in here are big pieces, the more I ate through the pint, the bigger the cookie pieces got. It’s as if Cookies & Cream Icecream, York Peppermint patty & Oreos had a baby. I just wish it wasn’t so expensive! I need coupons so I can stock up on this flavor! PLEASE Don’t ever get rid of it!\n",
            "First time trying this flavor and it wasn’t good. There were no cookie pieces at all. I kept waiting to get to the bottom and still no cookies. The bottom was even hollow so 1/4 of the container just had nothing but air.\n",
            "I don't write reviews, or didn't prior to today...I love this ice cream so much, it encompasses everything about a mint and chocolate cookie combination that makes me dream about eating more and more and more. I would live inside my pint if I could, build a little mint ice cream igloo with a cookie door, eat my way out and rebuild\n",
            "I check for this flavor every single time I'm in an ice cream isle, even if I'm not buying ice cream that day. I *scout* for it, all over the US. And I almost NEVER find it. I found the first pint in the last five years and it's still the best ice cream pint there is. Fresh but decadent but light but chomky. The fricken best.\n",
            "This was my favorite ice cream flavor of all time. Always bought this flavor whenever I could find it. But, unfortunately now, its made with coconut oil and I'm allergic to coconut. I wish I would've looked at the container before purchasing it. I did look at the website before going to the store, and didn't see coconut oil in the ingredients. Maybe the website needs to be updated?? Would be more vigilant next time at the store and read all products. Ben & Jerry's does make great ice cream, I just got to be more proactive and always double check.\n",
            "At first bite I could taste a mellow mint flavor over what is otherwise Chocolate Cookie Vanilla Ice Cream; sadly I sat there eating the rest of the pint not out of enjoyment but out of a desperate attempt to acquire the elusive mint flavor that was lacking. Long story short, I ate the entire pint and was disappointed not only in this flavor but myself. Also the texture was missing that of a chewy/crunch found only in a chocolate chip; if you are looking for that added chocolaty textured greatness the cookie alone will not bring you any solace.\n",
            "I like big chunks and I cannot lie! You other B&J fans can't deny! Well, most of you- my friend prefers sorbet. Anyway, ever since Mint Oreos have been put on the shelves, they've been my favorite flavor! So when I saw this at my grocery store, I did a happy dance in the frozen aisle. The peppermint is to die for, and the chocolate sandwich cookies are like oreos! You did it again, B&J.\n",
            "My wife and I are both mint chocolate ice cream fans so when we found this one at the store, we had to try it. First off, the mint ice cream: rich, creamy, minty and delicious. And the mint tastes natural. Sometimes other brand’s mint tastes so artificial. Next, not satisfied with chips, this ice cream gives you whole cream-filled cookies! Awesome awesome stuff.\n",
            "as a mint lover i can truthfully say that this is one of the best! my mom buys this one for me all the time though there are usually very little left in store. i highly recommend this one! much better than minter wonderland which is an abomination to this planet(see my review):) i would add an image of a happy gamer but the stock images are invalid lol\n",
            "I read several review on the good size of chunks and Great flavors. So when I was at my local supermarket and I saw this flavor I decided to step away from my usual purchase of phish food and half baked. But unfortunately I was very disappointed. There were no large chunks like reviews said. I am hoping thsi was a manufacturing error of some sort but the small pieces I did taste were also odd tasting.\n",
            "I don't enjoy chocolate chunks/chips in cold foods, but I like mint ice cream so much that I have bought mint chocolate chip ice cream, grudgingly eating around cocoa clusters. Thanks to Ben & Jerry's, there are no longer any obstacles to my enjoymint! Cookies are texturally lovely in this minty pint.\n",
            "Look. Ben, Jerry, Ben & Jerry, whatever you two go by, this ice cream is too good. You’ve got me hooked like I’ve never been hooked on ice cream before, and I can’t see any end in sight. How did it happen? I don’t know, but what I do know is I can’t complain.\n",
            "It's good overall, I wish they had a plain cookies and creme or a Mint Chocolate Chip. Similar to a thin-mint from the Girl Scouts. Not a favorite with me.\n",
            "This is the best ice cream don’t @ me. I’m allergic to milk but I am willing to risk it all for this ice cream anytime I can find it.\n",
            "My first pint of MCC (“Mint Chocolate Cookie”) changed my outlook on life and I haven’t looked back since. Strongly recommend.\n",
            "The mint cookie is truly the most supreme ice cream flavor ever invented: not too minty, not too chocolatey... perfect distribution of ingredients, and don't get me started on the exquisite texture. It's unfortunate that I have to eat the whole pint in one sitting. I recently moved to a city with a store that has this magnificent flavor stocked almost every day. The previous place I lived... there was some sort of shortage. I could only find it in random stores once or twice a year. SO, you'd think this is a GOOD thing: that I now have access to my favorite flavor almost every day. Guys, this is a HORRIBLE thing. The store near me is also open 24 hours... you get the picture. So, I declare to anyone who reads these things: TODAY IS MY LAST DAY TO TASTE AND ENJOY THIS SUPERB AMBROSIA> I'm kicking it... tomorrow. \n",
            "This was my go to Pint. It is disappearing from stores. please don't retire this flavor.\n",
            "This ice cream flavor is one of my reasons to live, no joke\n",
            "Mint chocolate chip is my absolute favorite flavor of ice cream. I don’t eat ice cream very often, but this is definitely a go-to. This ice cream even takes it a step further by having a cookies and cream twist. i was surprised the first time I had opened it because I thought maybe the label was wrong, but when I dug in, I could not be happier. Definitely check this out if you want a twist on the your favorite mint chocolate or cookies and cream.\n",
            "Ben & Jerry's is my favorite Ice Cream Brand. I recommend this to all my friends because I firmly believe that this Ice Cream will rule the nation. Therefore, my friends eat with appreciate that Ben & Jerry will rule the world. I have created an cult for this amazing business and we pray everyday with this Ice Cream. Sometimes in this because we love the smell of this ice cream. So I thank you, Ben & Jerry. I Love you.\n",
            "I love it! Would love to see it swirled with natural peanut butter. This is my favorite flavor!\n",
            "Bought it yesterday, was rly excited to give it a try. however, had almost no cookies and was mostly stuffed with mint ice cream. The mint taste was vigorous to an extent of repulsion.... had to throw it away half way... very dissapointing!!\n",
            "I love this flavor, I love chocolate cookies in everything. But recently I've noticed the cream filling of the cookies has a really weird, unpleasant texture...kind of hard and crumbly. No one is here for the filling anyway, get rid of that! Also a few pints I've gotten have had almost whole cookies in there. Not easy to eat, break them up more! If you did these two things, this flavor would be A+.\n",
            "Was excited to try a new flavor of Ben & Jerry's, but I just ended up being super disappointed in Mint Chocolate Chip. It had a very, VERY strong mint flavor and almost no chocolate cookies, it was very strange. Maybe I just got a bad pint, which is very possible, because this was just no good. I wish I would have spent that money on a different flavor.\n",
            "Since Mint Chip isn't available by the pint, and no scoop shops exist where I live, I tried this flavor and was beyond disappointed. The cookies are disgusting, it tasted like soggy Oreos coated in toothpaste and glue. I will never buy another pint, unless Mint Chip miraculously becomes available.\n",
            "So I just bought this today and from the reviews I was expecting a lot of cookie chunks. I guess I was wrong because after eating half the pint I got ZERO cookie chunks just some very disappointing specks of cookie. The mint taste is also VERY strong to the point where you start feeling sick. I’m really disappointed with this ice cream and I REALLY don’t recommend it.\n",
            "I recently bought Ben & Jerry's - Mint Chocolate Cookie ice cream. Unfortunately, this ice cream did not taste like mint.\n",
            "Ben & Jerry's really nailed it with this ice cream. It is so good! Ben & Jerry's is known for their quality and this is no exception.A excellent mint taste and ice cream treat. I just wish they would include more mint cookie pieces.This has become my new favorite ice cream. The mint and Oreo cookies are a perfect combination.\n",
            "Im sorry, maybe i dont know how to read, but im pretty sure this says MINT chocolate chip ice cream?? am i wrong? this simply looks like oreos in vanilla ice cream, which is obviously VERY BORING and no where near exciting as MINT chocolate chip. i dont even want to buy this after seeing these photos. #disappointed.\n",
            "Big fan of Ben and Jerry's ice cream. Cookies and cream is one of my favorite ice cream flavors, and adding the mint cookies takes it to the next level. A delicious treat that is the perfect size for just a coulple of people. The only complain I have would be that it is a little bit pricy for not a lot of ice cream\n",
            "This is by far the best flavor in the world. It has all the right flavors, and textures. By only complaint is that it is not infinite. I have been looking for this flavor for a long time, and found it here. I love mint ice cream, and I love cookies and cream. It is something I could only dream about.\n",
            "Ben and Jerry's have to be my favourite ice cream brand, they have so many amazing flavours to choose from. My current favourite is the Mint Chocolate Chip Cookie, it just amazing. If you like mint chocolate chip then you will love this ice cream too. Makes for the perfect treat on a summers day x\n",
            "When I go to get ice cream this is the brand I always reach for. Its affordable in my opinion, about 4 bucks. Its a rick creamy ice cream and the flavors are strong. I always buy this for the nights I want to relax and watch a movie. Its a perfect amount for you and your partner. Or just you.\n",
            "I’m not a huge fan of mint chocolate chip ice cream, but I love chocolate and mint so I’m so happy I found this flavor! The Oreos are a great addition to mint flavored ice cream. There were huge chunks of Oreos. I also love that the ice cream is not dyed green like some other mint ice cream!\n",
            "Because Im in college and only live in a dorm, these little pints of ice cream are really convenient. Theyre small enough to fit in the small freezer space of a mini fridge. Mint chocolate chip is my favorite flavor, but every flavor of Ben & Jerrys that Ive purchased has been good.\n",
            "The Mint Chocolate Cookie has become a fun search and devour game for my wife and I. No matter where we are traveling if we go into a store that sells ice cream we look for B&J's MCC. It's getting harder to find. I fear one day you may kill the cookie and send it to your graveyard.\n",
            "I eated last year in my USA trip and loved it!The cookies go way better than just chocolate chips.Its even better because in Brazil they only have one kind of mint ice cream that is no available in the grocery stores any that have giant chunks of chocolate in a enormous quantity.\n",
            "This has been my favorite flavor for YEARS! I love it so much and have driven to the store at night just to buy it. The peppermint flavor is perfect and the whole size cookies you get sometimes are an added bonus. The best ice cream of all time. Go buy it, you won't regret it :)\n",
            "I love this flavor so much, I have been eating a pint a day ( i know, im addicted ) . They really do need to up the sandwich cookie numbers in the batches, lately it seemingly had very little cookie chunks. But when there is a decent amount of cookie chunks ,’im in heaven!!!\n",
            "I am a BIG fan of mint chocolate chip ice cream so when I found Ben & Jerry's version I was head over heels. I even got my father in law & son addicted to it! This is the most amazing mixture and i can't get enough of it. THANK YOU Ben & Jerry, absolutley LOVE this!!\n",
            "Im a big ice cream fan. It can be a little expensive but its completely worth it this ice cream is filled with delightful flavouring and will satisfy every tease with their humungous list of flavours. Great for a small snack or even a binge eat! Highly recommend\n",
            "I worry that this flavor may get taken off shelves one day as it gets more and more difficult to find. This has been my favorite flavor since child hood, because I love mint ice cream but was never a fan of chocolate chips in my teeth so cookies are perfect!\n",
            "I generally like mint chocolate cookie but the last pint I got was very disappointing- all the cookie chunks were gathered in the bottom, all the ice cream was on top and very icy. Maybe it melted at some point, which I assume was the grocery store's fault?\n",
            "I love this icecream it's the best. It's very delicious and you won't be disappointed at all with the flavor. This delicious icecream are the best compared to any others. I'm a repeat consumer. I love it. I would definitely recommend this to everybody.\n",
            "I love this ice cream I've been having it since I was very little and I love this ice cream with all my heart Ben & Jerry's is a very good ice cream bread and I would definitely recommend this to another person because it's not too pricey and I love it\n",
            "Amazing product I’ve tecommended it to my mother my father my aunt my best friend my husband loves it I love it I can’t get enough of it I only wish I’d tried it sooner it smells amazing too ugh one of those holy grail products I’ll never live with out\n",
            "Oooof. I love this. I know I shouldn’t eat so much but I love the creaminess and that the mint is really flavorful but not overly strong. The cookies are yummy and I love that they include thick sandwich cookies instead of just a thin chocolate cookie.\n",
            "I really like this ice cream because it is really good for the cost. The only thing that I wish is that they had a strictly mint chip ice cream instead of the one with cookies. Other than that, I buy it all the time and it is really good!\n",
            "you can NEVER go wrong with Ben and Jerry’s!!!! I love mint anything so I was really excited to try this. I thought it would be a little more chocolate-ty but it was still declines. I’d recommend to anyone wanting a good mint ice cream.\n",
            "This ice cream is fantastic. Flavour is great and truly refreshing. It is probably my favourite brand of ice cream but I barely buy it because the price is ridiculous. The portions are tiny and expensive. Maybe change the packaging?\n",
            "Ben&Jerry ice cream never fails to be absolutely delicious. Its always creamy, theres so many flavors to choose from and they come in sizes that keep me from going overboard. When they go on sale Im always sure to buy some.\n",
            "As stated, this is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE ICE CREAM!!!! My only critic is to get rid of the cookie filling. It’s the only thing that doesn’t translate well. If I could order it special without the filling, I DEFINITELY would!\n",
            "Was excited to try this as I'm a big fan of both C&C and mint ice cream. However, this missed the mark for me. I'd rather have plain ol' C&C or mint choc. chip ice cream instead. This one had an odd flavor and aftertaste.\n",
            "Can I just say OH MY GOODNESS!!! This is so incredibly delicious! I love so many different flavors of Ben and Jerrys! Who doesn't? I will say I do find it a bit pricey for a little container but, I will continue to buy!\n",
            "This is their best flavor. It's like the Girl Scout cookie, Thin Mint, in an ice cream. This is easily my favorite. The mint isn't overpowering and there's plenty of cookies too! I always buy it when B&J is on sale.\n",
            "This is my favorite flavor ever. Whenever nobody's home, I take out my spoon and eat away. It's the absolute perfect balance between mint and cookie dough. I had at least 3+ huge cookie pieces. Very very satisfied!!!\n",
            "I bought this flavor today on a whim and was so happy I did! I couldn’t believe how many actual cookie pieces were in it. It took a lot of self control to not finish the entire pint. Will definitely be buying again\n",
            "I love Haagen Das Mint Chip, so I thought I’d give this a try. The flavor of the ice cream had a strange metal like after taste. This sounds more delicious than it actually is. I wish I could have my money back.\n",
            "Meant chocolate chip cookie is one of my favorite flavors from Ben & Jerry’s. You really can’t go wrong with this flavor or any player from Ben & Jerry’s for that matter. I can go through a whole bin in one sitting\n",
            "I visited relatives near Phoenix, & was naturally inclined to find something cold to eat. i went to Wal-mart, found this & fell in love with it! Haven't found it in WA yet though 9which is a real heart breaker).\n",
            "I love dessert!! I have a huge sweet tooth and these ice creams fulfill each and every bit of that craving for me! This is basically cookies in cream but mint style and I love it!! It’s refreshing and delicious!!\n",
            "It’s not good these are so small. I know there are multiple servings in one but they make it so freaking easy to just zone out and eat the whole thing in one night. I’m not really complaining. It tastes amazing.\n",
            "I love mint chocolate cookie.\n",
            "Unfortunately I have not had it in about five years or so because I can't find it anywhere from Cape Coral Florida down to the Florida key's.\n",
            "I want my mint chocolate cookie!!!!!\n",
            "The ice cream is very delicious but not worth the price in my opinion. The container is so small I could finish it in a day. The ice cream is quite expensive just because it’s a big brand. Would not recommend\n",
            "Im a sucker for both cookies and cream and mint ice cream but to have both in one?!? Omfg deliciousness is blissfully amazing! I totally recommend if you love both flavors to have in one ice cream pint cup.\n",
            "Mint chocolate chip ice cream is my favourite ice cream. Grab a tub of this for a movie night... or any night and you’re good to go. Grocery store or gas station you can pick up a pint and enjoy the night.\n",
            "Ben n Jerry’s is my favorite! When they came out with this flavor I was in love! Not many people are fond of mint flavors but this brand and flavor is my go to ice cream when I’m craving something sweet.\n",
            "The best, hands down. Thick ice cream, big chunks of chocolate cookies, and the best flavor ever. Probably not the best if you have a dairy sensitivity, its a heavy ice cream. I would highly recommend!\n",
            "Cookies and cream with a hint of mint. Omg this stuff is amazing. Once you have one bite you have to force yourself not to eat the whole thing. Always have this or any ben and Jerry’s in my freezer.\n",
            "Ben and Jerry’s are my main men. But seriously they make the best Ice cream and have so many flavors. Every time I’m in the grocery store it is so hard to choose just one flavor to take home with.\n",
            "The best one they make next to Boom!. I don't just want ice cream, I want STUFF IN MY ice cream! They give so may cookies in here. I pile them in the lid and eat them at the end. YOU ARE WELCOME\n",
            "Usually ice cream gives me a belly ake and leaves me feeling yucky but I can honestly say this one doesnt. I love this brand its full of flavor and makes me feel good at the end of eating it.\n",
            "This ice cream is so so so good! My husband and daughter both love it as well. I love how it doesnt become rock hard like most ice creams! Its really pricey for how big it is but it so good!!\n",
            "When I picked this up I thought I was getting mint chocolate chip but to my delight I got this wonderful ice cream. The flavors blend so well. One of the best ice creams I've ever eaten.\n",
            "This is, without any doubt (at least to the writer) the very best ice cream ever produced. The subtle mint flavour combined with the Oreo-like cookie chunks makes this simple the best!\n",
            "I was actually nomming on this just last night. It is more of a cookies and cream with mint added than a regular mint chocolate chip but it is still amazing and I absolutely love it.\n",
            "I saw that somehow Mint Chocolate Cookie was close to 4 stars and had to jump in. Great flavor. One of their best. The haters out there can not possibly be ice cream aficionados.\n",
            "This answer was really good this ice cream was really good I am really enjoyed eating it it has a sweetness and then it has like a meaty flavor and they all blend in together\n",
            "I love anything Ben & Jerry’s ice cream that doesn’t have fruit in it but this one was my favorite it taste good it doesn’t give. Me a stomachache and it’s reasonably priced\n",
            "Mmm minty , creamy delicious , tasty amazing melt in your mouth Ben & Jerry ice cream, another amazing best buy for hot weather like this can sit and enjoy and cool down .\n",
            "Love love love! Can’t get over how good Ben and Jerry’s ice cream is. It’s a little more pricey comepared to other brands but totally worth it. I’ve never had a bad one.\n",
            "Our family lovesicecreaman Ben and Jerry's. We like it so much that we have purchased Ben and Jerry's cookbook to make their ice creams at the house whenever we want to.\n",
            "full size cookies, the best mint ice cream out there!!!! Always my go to, I will go to multiple stores to find it...I can never get sick of this kind of ice cream.\n",
            "this icecream is a classic. i love the taste, flavor, and texture. wish it came in a lower calorie and carb and sugar version but its bad because it is soo good.\n",
            "I deff love ice cream and can't ever go wrong with it either, break up and not hungry? Hey get some of these bad boys the cold numb the pain haha :)\n",
            "I love this flavor. The chocolate cookies pair beautifully with a classic mint ice cream. I also love that the ice cream isn’t artificially colored!\n",
            "Lets talk about yum! This ice cream is so delicious, I get it every time I go to the store, no other mint chocolate cookie ice cream even compares\n",
            "I LOVE this flavor and have never been disappointed. Wish it was in all stores where Ben and Jerry’s is sold though! Kind of hard to find it.\n",
            "By far one of my favorite mint icecream flavor! The minty coolness of the icecream with HUGE chunks of Oreo-like cookies makes it so good\n",
            "Love mint chocolate chip and the fact that theres a cookie as well in the ice cream! Minty and cookie mix is the best kind of ice cream\n",
            "i love ice cream and ben&jerry's makes some of the best ice cream out there. their recipe is amazing and it tastes great every time\n",
            "This is beyond my favorite ice cream flavor on the planet! But it is not available in any stores near me. How do we fix this?!?!\n",
            "Finally, a mint ice cream that doesn’t look like a liquified and frozen Hulk. This really is the most amazing ice cream available.\n",
            "My favorite mint ice cream on the market and I've tried all of them. ;) I love the lack of green and all the giant cookie chunks.\n",
            "Favorite flavor ever. So good! Nice light peppermint flavor and cookies mixed in adds just the right extra flavor and texture.\n",
            "Ugh so good. Its pricey for a small carton of it so its not really in my budget to eat this all the time. But its still yummy\n",
            "Anything with mint automatically wins me over. This is the perfect combination of flavors and perfect for a late night treat.\n",
            "I love mint chocolate ice cream and Ben & Jerry’s outdid it with the Oreo cookies in this one!! Delicious! Eat the whole tub!\n",
            "Bought this because I wanted some cookies, not just a carton of peppermint icecream. not a single cookie, nary a fragment.\n",
            "I’ve always loved ben and jerry’s ice cream! It’s much better than most brands i’ve seen, a bit pricey but it’s worth it!\n",
            "This is my favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor. The mint is nice and sweet and I love running into the cookie pieces as I go.\n",
            "I love Mint Chocolate Cookie! It has always been my favorite but lately I can’t find it anywhere! Where can I get it??\n",
            "Absolutely love almost any flavor of Ben and Jerrys. Definitely would recommend. I am an ice cream lover to the core.\n",
            "I loveeeeeeeeeeeeee ice cream, I eat my feelings with ice cream, it just makes everything better and this is great\n",
            "It is bad in the mint. The mint is too strong and outpowers the rest. Breyers actually makes this one really well.\n",
            "I love this take on a mint chocolate ice cream - a great peppermint ice cream base with OREOS. What a great combo\n",
            "It's just so good. Speaking of ice cream, how much would it cost to get a lifetime's supply? I'm just curious.\n",
            "Perfect combo!!! The chocolate ice cream isn’t a heavy chocolate and tastes so good. Such a great a flavor!!!\n",
            "Ben & Jerry’s ice cream is the best hands down. It’s a little on the pricier side but well worth the money!!!\n",
            "This product is my favorite I love cookies and cream and they made it taste even better love the product\n",
            "Love to eat every morning before school and tastes great as can be. Tastes perfect all the time everyday\n",
            "Love Ben and Jerry the mint chocolate flavour bring something fresh into the milky nest of the icecream\n",
            "Ben and Jerry’s is the best brand out there and is well worth the price! Such a fun variety of flavors\n",
            "One of my favorite ice creams amazing I love love ice cream when I’m sick and it helps me feel better\n",
            "My favorite ice cream in the world! Awesome flavor and perfect combination for Netflix and bed hahah\n",
            "For Mint and Chip Lovers if you haven’t tried this ice cream you are missing out ! Delicious!\n",
            "This is such a good flavor. Ben and Jerry’s just can’t do me wrong. This ones a total winner.\n",
            "They never disappoint! Lots of chunks and deliciousness. My favorite go to after a long day.\n",
            "an ice cream very delicious, super creamy, and perfect haha I love it is very good product\n",
            "this is my absolute favorite ice cream and i will eat it even when it’s freezing outside\n",
            "I love mint chocolate cookie! It’s perfect after a spicy meal. Lots of cookie chunks.\n",
            "One of my favorite flavors ever. Pretty pretty PLEASE make this a non-dairy flavor!!!\n",
            "My favorite mint ice cream!! The best part is how big the Oreo chunks are. So good!\n",
            "The best ice cream I have ever tasted...no other ice cream comes close to this!\n",
            "It’s so creamy, perfect crispy cookie bits, and smooth minty flavor. The bomb\n",
            "If you're a mint person, this is for you. This ice cream is freaking amazing.\n",
            "This is literally my favorite ice cream and I’m said I can never find it!\n",
            "Best ice cream of all time!! Been eating this one for at least 20 years\n",
            "Love that is it not too sweet or too strong of mint flavor. So Good!\n",
            "Mint Chocolate Cookie has been my favorite flavor since college!\n",
            "This is hands down my go to, never let's me down favorite!\n",
            "Rich and decedent, this is a great flavor if you like mint and dark chocolate. Just looking at that glassy smooth ice cream just after taking the lid off makes my mouth water. It’s not as minty as Mint Chocolate Cookie, which is fine, and the dark chocolate ice cream is so decedent! The marshmallow is a perfect addition and the cookie is great. I’m glad I found this new flavor. Yum yum!\n",
            "I was so sad when Gimme S'mores season was over but when I saw Minter Wonderland staring at me through the freezer case door, I knew it was meant to be. It's decadantly creamy and perfectly chocolately. Not too rich or bitter like a lot of other dark chocolates; plus the gooeyness of the marshamallows balances with the crunchiness of the cookies. One of my favorite flavors EVER.\n",
            "I have contemplated this review for quite some time. Unfortunately, it is officially time to let you all know about the greatest ice cream EVER MADE! I am flabbergasted that more people have never heard of this ingenious creation. It is by far the most perfected ice cream, which contains the best combination of flavors and ingredients to hit this planet. I am saddened to know that this review will for sure be read by millions and in turn lower my chances of being the only one at my local target eating this ice cream. I have withheld this important message for this long due to my own need to always have a fully stocked freezer of this amazing product. All i ask is that if you are contemplating buying more than 15 of these pints at once, just leave enough for myself to stock my personal Minter Wonderland freezer at home. Now to get to the real reason for this review. I am hoping that one of the millions that read this review may work for Ben and Jerry's or Target and start the long needed process to make this ice cream available ALL year and in ALL locations. Thank you and please do not touch MY Minter Wonderland pint.\n",
            "Minter Wonderland, leaves you wondering where the mint is. Mint chocolate cookie has more of a mint taste. I was so excited to try, but incredibly disappointed.\n",
            "I'm only a few bites in but it is so good I couldn't help but write a review. Decadent dark chocolate, mint, and marshmallow- couldn't ask for much more.\n",
            "While this ice cream wasn't as minty as I was expecting it to be, the dark chocolate flavor was so rich and so spot on. Dark chocolate ice creams and milk shakes are my favorite and surprisingly most difficult flavor to find. I was instantly hooked on the dark chocolate flavor of this ice cream. The minty cookies are refreshing and the marshmallow swirl adds just the perfect sweetness.\n",
            "seriously... this is THE BEST flavor ever.... I wish it wasnt exclusive to Target only (always sold out)\n",
            "O M G I tasted this and dashed to the store to clean out the freezer of this earthly delight! It is hands down THE best dark chocolate I have tasted, and the marshmallow and mint are perfect. I let my daughter taste some (yeah, WHAT was I thinking?) and now I will have to battle her in seeking and buying it all at the local stores. My freezer has 6 pints in it--LOL. would I recommend it?-- My answer says YES, but my heart says NO!-more for me!\n",
            "If you're craving girl scout cookies but they're out of season you should buy this instead. Because this is EXACTLY like an ice cream version of thin mints. This is the first mint chocolate ice cream I have ever enjoyed and the chocolate ice cream is so rich with the perfect hint of mint. A new favorite of mine and my husband's! That says a lot since we exclusively buy Ben and Jerry's for ice cream\n",
            "I noticed this flavor around the holidays and have been hooked ever since!! Prior to this I liked the S'more and Boom-Choco-Latta, but nothing like Minter Wonderland. It has a smooth dark chocolate with a back lining of mint, and the cookie and marshmallow make for a great texture in between. You really outdid yourselves this time guys!!\n",
            "Perfect balance of mint, chocolate and marshmallow!\n",
            "The rich, velvety, delectably dark chocolate ice cream is a delight in and of itself. Pair it with gooey marshmallow swirls and crumbly chocolate cookies and you begin to gaze into perfection. My only wish is for it to be more readily available... It's hard to find where I live and I have to drive a ways to find it.\n",
            "The pinnacle of ice cream achievement. All other flavors pale in comparison. Ben, Jerry, please, I am on my knees begging you to keep this flavor available year-round. I promise you there is a market. Heck, I will eat enough annually to BE the market. This is the only flavor for me.\n",
            "I've been a Ben & Jerry's fan since day one and have tasted most of their flavors. This exclusive flavor is one of the most sublime flavors they've ever done. It's practically pause-the-TV good and I wish it was brought into the regular rotation because it's amazing.\n",
            "I tried this last year after finding it at target to try it out and it has became my all time favorite ice cream ever. But I haven’t been able to find it for the last few months so have been pretty disappointed. Hope to find it again soon!\n",
            "This is one of my favorites ! I’ve tried about 25 different Ben and Jerry’s and usually don’t buy a flavor twice. But I really like this one and would buy it again. It’s super rich and has the perfect amount of mint. And I don’t usually like mint ice cream\n",
            "Genuinely, this flavor will change the way you look at and eat ice cream. I've written to ben and jerry's to beg this be in stores year round. Dark chocolate ice cream with the perfect amount of chunks is hard to find. This is such gold and I adore it.\n",
            "We discovered this by accident, a whim to look at ice cream that day. Brought it home and loved it. Gone back twice for more. I just wish our local supermarket carried it. Had to go to a Target, which is less convenient.\n",
            "I just came upon this flavor recently & fell in love! It’s better than I expected. Not too much mint but just enough & the marshmallow makes it even better! This is definitely a new favorite for me.\n",
            "Didn’t know what to expect with this flavor.... but WOW! I hope they make this year round! By far one of the best flavors yet!!!! Not too minty it chocolatey... perfect flavor combo of each!!!\n",
            "This flavor is everything and should be sold year-round in all grocery stores pls and ty. The combo of the rich dark chocolate + cool mint + soft marshmallow swirl + cookie crunch = perfect\n",
            "I bought this ice cream yesterday and I have literally never loved an ice cream more. Half-baked used to be my all time favorite but this takes the cake. Can't get enough!\n",
            "Chocolate marshmallow is my favorite ice cream flavor. Mint chip is my one of my other faves. This combines the 2 perfectly. Please keep making this!\n",
            "My husbands last name is Minter and this ice cream is amazing. The combination of chocolate, marshmallow, fudge, and mint is perfect.\n",
            "This by far is my favorite flavor, I never thought I would find a flavor I enjoyed more the brownie batter, but this takes the cake!\n",
            "This is a fantastic mix of winter goodness. It tastes like a magical tastebud trip to the North Pole break room for Santa’s elves.\n",
            "Absolutely the best chocolate flavor. It's almost as if Phish Food and a Girl Scout cookie had a little ice cream baby. Amazing.\n",
            "Obsessed with this flavor. Please please please make it permanent! It's my perfect ice cream, and I'll be so sad when it's gone!\n",
            "I’ve wasted so much time energy and gas... here it is the day b4 Xmas and STILL cannot find this flavor!!!! Not ok B&J\n",
            "This target exclusive flavor is my ABSOLUTE favorite Ben & Jerry’s flavor. Please don’t ever get rid of it!!\n",
            "The dark chocolate, marshmallow, mint combo is refreshing and decadent. Make this year 'round please\n",
            "Stumbled on this flavor in Target. You had me at Dark Chocolate! Absolutely AMAZING!!!!\n",
            "I love this flavour most of all ice cream brands and/or flavours out there. I used to buy it whenever I landed at the airport (back to school) after Christmas vacation up North in Norway, back in the day when it still was sold here. Now they have discontinued this flavour for some unknown reason (it can't be due to consumer preferance- I'm sure!!!) and allthough there are a lot of good ice cream out there, it is just not the same without the super chunky rich chocolate flavour of B&J's New York Super fudge chunk. Can someone please tell my disinformed country to BRING IT BACK??! Thank you. Cincerely yours (having withdrawal symptoms as we speak)\n",
            "I look for this Ice Cream in every store I go in to but there are never ANY of them. There are places near us who sell Ben and Jerry's but never type. WalMart - South Charleston, WV and Kroger, Danville, WV are two locations in between where we live. The WalMart gets a lot of traffic and I know it would sell well there. PLEASE help a sister out. I have lost 100 lbs in the last few years and this is my treat to myself but I can never find it anywhere. It is the BEST Ice Cream in all of the LAND .. please, please send some to those locations lol.\n",
            "Nothing beats, At the end of a busy day cuddling up under a blanket with my babies and eating Ben and Jerry's ice cream. We love this ice cream. Thank you B&J\n",
            "This is my very favorite ice cream flavor -- not just my favorite Ben & Jerry's ice cream, but of all brands. Whenever we are having ice cream treats, I buy this for myself in addition to whatever flavor is bought for everyone else.\n",
            "This has been my favorite for a long time. I love the chocolate ice cream. I would like to see more flavors with this yummy ice cream as the base. I also look forward to the white chocolate and chocolate covered nuts.\n",
            "This is a great tasting ice cream I love the chocolate and nuts in it. I am originally from New York State, so this is a very fitting ice cream for me.\n",
            "This is also my very favorite Ben and Jerry’s flavor.\n",
            "Been a fan since its debut! The very best chocolate ice cream as the base, with tons of chocolate chunks and nuts to keep it exciting. We come back to this flavor every time and have never been disappointed\n",
            "This is without a doubt my all time favourite ice cream. I used to love phish food but then I discovered New York super fudge chunk and have never looked back. Not just my favourite Ben & Jerry’s ice cream but my favourite ice cream. The chocolate is divine and all the different chunks are really what makes it so special. It’s just a shame that it’s so hard to come by at times and I am terrified that one day it might get discontinued. I might just have to buy in bulk now and save up just in case!\n",
            "In my opinion this is the best flavor by far. It is so fun to find a chocolate covered nut and chocolate chips. I am not a white chocolate fan but this ice cream is super chocolatey and the while chocolate really complements it. It is super chocolate! And it is so hard to find in stores it is always sold out. Maybe it should move up in the ranks of the favorite flavors.\n",
            "Received as a mistake sent to my daughter-in-law. NOT A Mistake for Me!! Absolutely EVERYTHING I would have put in it if I'd made it myself!!\n",
            "Best ice cream in history. Perfection. FUDGE CHUNK DADDY!\n",
            "I’ve bought this several times going to see a movie, the textures and complex profiles of buttery-rich savory flavors leaves a satisfying experience for someone who doesn’t typically indulge in sweets and desserts. The level of variety of textures in this is really an enjoyable experience unlike other ice creams that try to work in nuts or chunks of chewables that really feel like a hindrance to the chewing aspect, but not this. No. This is done right and there is nothing more that could be improved upon. Love this!\n",
            "There is just no comparison for the New York Super Fudge Chunk.\n",
            "I first bought the New York Suoer Fudge Chunk about 2 months ago. It's the best icecream they have. So perfect. Contains all the favorites. Highly recommend\n",
            "NYSFC is the best. For all of us chunk loving chocolate fanatics who don't want their ice cream cut with marshmallows, or unchocolatified by caramel, this is paradise in the mouth. Please never discontinue this flavor!! I say this not because I live in New York. I'd love it if it were Wyoming or Rhode Island Super Fudge Chunk. I say it because it must be said.\n",
            "New York Super Fudge Chunk is the greatest flavor ever, This is my go to ice cream. I have tried other flavors of B&J and while they are good, this one knocks my socks off everytime. We don't have a local shop and sometimes finding this flavor is difficult but I will hunt all the stores till I find it. Please don't ever discontinue this flavor or I will die!\n",
            "Heaven in ice cream form; so much crunch, so much texture, I've never been so satisfied with an ice cream\n",
            "miss that icecream sooo much- it was the best for me. Please come back to Hamburg-Germany\n",
            "Bring it back to Holland!!!!!!!!!!! It is the best icecream ever!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
            "I have been a fan of New York Super Chunk since its inception, I think I started enjoying it more than 15 years ago. I WILL ALWAYS love NYSC but I try others too!!! Pecan pie is a goodie too!!! Thanks~~\n",
            "This was referred to me by a friend a few years back and its been my favorite ever since. The fudge is amazing, along with the nuts! I have tried and liked other flavors but I always go back to New York Super Fudge! I would love to be able to buy the Fudge as well as the ice cream!\n",
            "OMG. This ice cream is Bliss in a Bucket. I have never had a more wonderful ice cream. I am quitting sugar, so this is going to have to go. Honestly, it is the thing I will miss the most. It is gonna be a super painful breakup.\n",
            "This my favorite ice cream. The chocolate is deep and rich with chunks of chocolate and nuts. It is the Best! Unfortunately, I can't seem to find it at our local stores. I will keep trying though. after all it is the Best!\n",
            "As I sit here eating a pint I love this ice cream the best chocolate mix ever been eating this flavor for years\n",
            "I cannot resist this ice cream! I always have to buy it when I see it. And usually eat the whole pint myself. . .\n",
            "Love this. Bring it back to Canada please! Nuts and chocolate chunks. Delicious.\n",
            "Delicous....flavor is just amazing! I love this ice cream.\n",
            "i cannot stop eating this icecream.super duper love it!\n",
            "Always my favorite. Just love the white fudge chucks.\n",
            "OMG! New York Super Fudge Chunk. This is my favorite flavor. I introduced it to a picky ice cream eater and they loved it too. But We Need More!!!! We have not been able to find this flavor over the last couple of months at our grocers in Gadsden, AL. We were getting it at Walmart (preferred) and Winn Dixie but lately it has not been available.\n",
            "This was the first Ben & Jerry’s flavour I ever tried and it is still to this day my absolute favourite!! A friend bought it when it first debuted because I was feeling blue and I have been hooked ever since! It has everything you need in an ice cream, deliciously joined into one amazing tub. I may even get some this weekend just because. :-)\n",
            "I’m a big time Chocoholic and ice cream lover. This is the most flavorful, chocolatey, chunky, chocolate covered nut ice cream EVER! This has been my favorite since it came out. I’ve been to the Vermont factory and taken the tour. Loved the Flavor Cemetery. I’m just glad New York Super Fudge Chunk is not in there!\n",
            "Let me start by saying you have caused this Texan to defect from Blue Bell long before the Issue they had a few years back. I have not only fallen in love with this awesome flavor, it has caused me to part ways with long-term \"friend\" Rocky Road\n",
            "Yes parting is such sweet sorrow, but in this case \"BYE FELICIA!\"\n",
            "This is my very favorite ice cream of all time! Sometimes stores don’t sell it- so when I see it in a store I get so happy! Chocolate icecream with chocolate chunks! It is so so good!!! It’s kinda good they don’t sell it at every store because I would eat way too much of this delicious stuff!!\n",
            "I usually don’t love nuts in ice cream but this one is different! The Ben and Jerry’s chocolate ice cream (the best chocolate ice cream on the market) and the fudge chunks are perfect and the nuts are nice. Really great pint all in all.\n",
            "I loveee chocolate ice cream and Ben and Jerry’s already gets that right. Then they add the SUPER FUDGE chunks. Yes!! Walnuts , white and dark chocolate pieces. My fav ever. A pint doesn’t last us long, ever.\n",
            "I used to always have this ice cream in my fridge but they discontinued it years ago here in Germany. So every time I visit the US it’s the first thing I buy.\n",
            "Please be so kind and bring it back to Europe!\n",
            "This is simply one of the best ice cream flavors anywhere!\n",
            "My only complaint is that it is not always easy to find. Grocery stores have it about half the time, convenience stores...not a chance.\n",
            "We need this back in the Netherlands!\n",
            "Easily the best flavor you have- only I can rarely find it. Is it because it sells out all the time? Also, I'm a teacher I think I should get free ice cream for year!\n",
            "Favorite flavour ever! Was thrilled to find it once up here, in Canada...can we have more, pleaaaase? I hope to never, ever see this one in the ice cream cemetery...\n",
            "I love this flavor and have been eating it since the 90's. I have a peanut allergy but this does not affect me. I don't indulge often as my luck run out!\n",
            "I found this flavor several months ago after looking for several years after Bear Claw (was my favorite flavor) stopped being sold around here any more.\n",
            "I’ve been eating this flavor for years. I’ve tried other great flavors but still always come back to this one.\n",
            "Can't stop buying this thing. And can't stop eating it. It's my only craving and I feel I'm kinda addicted! :)\n",
            "Everytime I have a chance to try to new flavors this point screams at me not to cheat on it. It is that good.\n",
            "I don't care for chocolate ice cream BUT......THIS IS THE BEST!!!!! Don't ever discontinue this product.\n",
            "In 2018, this is still my favorite flavor! Please keep it on the flavor roster.\n",
            "Love...love...love this. Hard to find sometimes but when's I do it's the best.\n",
            "Microwave 45 secs and bust out the spoon, pure pleasure from there...\n",
            "The best ice cream so far! Love it so much! Just AMAZING\n",
            "Absolutely delicious. My favorite ice cream since college in the early 90's. No other ice cream or flavor compares. Delicious rich chocolate ice cream, fudge and white chocolate chunks, chocolate covered almonds, and pecans. Not a fan of pecans but they taste fine here. My mom isn't usually a fan of chocolate ice cream, but she really likes this especially with the chunks and additions. It's perfection.\n",
            "This has always been my favorite!!! However, when I bought it this last time, there was a noticeable change in the recipe and it was not an improvement. It is good but not excellent. Not sure I would run to the store in the middle of the night for this one anymore. What changed?\n",
            "I purchased this a couple weeks ago, and from the reviews was expecting something that would make my taste buds sing, but it ended up being mostly a rather plain chocolate ice cream with a few chunks of chocolate and nut pieces mixed in. It was average.\n",
            "This is my all time favorite ice cream and I got so sad when I suddenly couldn't find it in any store.. It's been a few years, and no ice cream in the world could fill the void New York super fudge chunk left behind when it disappeared.\n",
            "I ate this ice cream throughout my whole pregnancy.I was 9 months walking in the middle of the heat to get to the only store relatively near me that carried the ice cream. Now my daughter is two years old and we both love it!!!\n",
            "I recently stopped buying NYSC after many years. The chocolate covered nuts now taste like Hazelnuts. I tried 3 different purchases at 3 different supermarkets. Sorry to have to stop buying this product. It was a great run\n",
            "I was at a scoop shop that has already had this flavor. This time they did not! I asked why and they said it was being discontinued. Is this true?\n",
            "LOVE IT! LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!!!\n",
            "This is the best flavour of them all! But Sweden has discontinued it for some reason! I have not found it in years.. Anyone who knows why??\n",
            "This is my favorite flavor and I want to have it all the time but can’t so please make in non dairy\n",
            "This combination is the only way that I eat chocolate ice cream.\n",
            "My second-favorite flavor ... bring back Truffle Kerfuffle!\n",
            "When Oatmeal Cookie Chunk stopped being made, I was DEVASTATED! It was the only Ben & Jerry's icecream that I bought regularly. So for years I've been really disappointed. Today while at the store I saw it and jumped for joy! I have to say this flavor is very similar to the old, except the oatmeal cookie part is more crunchy this time around. I'm still super pleased and hope its here to stay!!\n",
            "Like everyone else, I was excited to try this so called new flavor because the flavor description reminded me of my favorite flavor, the Oatmeal Cookie Chunk that randomly disappeared years ago..... Sadly this flavor is not as great. I've had it twice now and both times I was disappointed by the large amount of chocolate flakes versus actual oatmeal cinnamon cookies. The only thing that was right about this was the brown sugar base does taste like the cinnamon base from the original flavor. Anyway, I digress... It'll have to do since it's the closest they've gotten to resurrecting the Oatmeal Cookie Chunk. Just please less fudge flakes or you guys might as well change the name....\n",
            "Everything about this is great - the oatmeal cookie hunks, the cinnamon butter sugar brown I'm getting tongue tied just thinking about it - but I loathe chocolate. I feel like a good oatmeal cookie doesn't have chocolate in it - reserve that for the chocolate chip fans out there. But I tried this anyway, figuring the chocolate might be limited enough I could just grimace and get through it, but nope :( The chocolate was more apparent than the oatmeal cookie itself. This one was just an extra stab in the heart because I was holding out hope that the chocolate chunks were less common than they are in the Cherry Garcia.\n",
            "Alli can say is heaven lol. My all time favorite has alwaya been chunkey monkey mostly because of the delicious chunks of chocolate in the ice cream now i found another favorite which is this oat of this swirled. Im sorry to say but the other reviewers who are complaining are picky and can not compare or expect this to be the same as other past sinilar flavors. All in all the chocolate chunks with a cinnamon taste which fully satisfies my cravings. I have one problem though, once i start i can’t stop lol. Overall ben and jerry’s always comes through the right way.! Love ben and jerry’s! No im not sponsered (but i wish i was) ha!\n",
            "I'm not sure this is \"new\" it's reminiscent of a flavor I had a handful of years ago at a B&J's shop in Vegas. But in my opinion there could be a lot more cinnamon cookie swirls and a little less chocolate fudge flakes. I've had 2 pints now with not much on the cookie chunk front.\n",
            "The original oatmeal cookie ice cream was my all time favorite and I was saddened for years when it was taken off the shelfs. Imagine my surprise when I saw a new oatmeal flavor was introduced. I quickly purchased it and enjoyed it, but did notice there were not very many cookies chunks. Unfortunately ever since, I have not been able to find this flavor anywhere! All of my local retailers have plenty of urban burban and truffle kerfuffle - but no oat of this swirled anywhere in sight! I am having nightmares of this flavor being taken away again! And only after such a brief time! Say it ain't so Ben and Jerry!\n",
            "I was SO excited when they brought this flavor back to the shelves. I missed the Oatmeal Cookie Chuck (my absolutely all time favorite flavor) oh so much. But the excitement soon was lost when I realized it was not the same OCC I loved so much. There was no chunks of cookies in the ice cream, and I know it's supposed to be a swirl, but 1) it would actually be out of this world if there were the original OCC chunks in it and 2) there was hardly any oatmeal cookie swirl in it. I've bought it a few more times hoping that the production has gotten better with adding more of the oatmeal cookie, but nothing has changed. Very sad. I just wish they could add in the cookie chunks in it like they do for milk and cookies (but oatmeal of course). :(\n",
            "This was the second flavor of Ben & Jerry's that I tried and I fell in love with it! I came across a Facebook post about it helping another mom with her breastmilk supply, and decided to try it because I was breastfeeding at the time, but wasn't really expecting it to help. I really just wanted to try it because of the flavors lol. I've been kinda disappointed lately though because I always bought this flavor from Walmart or Food Lion, and I guess they've stopped carrying it because I've been in multiple locations for each store and none have it anymore. I had to make a trip across town to Target to get it because I was craving it smh\n",
            "This is the flavour my roommate always used to buy in college and it was through her that I tried it for the first time. Not gonna lie, it's good enough that I (shamefully, and maybe a little drunkenly) was compelled to steal a small spoonful after a late night out. The brown sugar base is just so rich, that when paired with the oat cookies, you just feel all warm and cozy. Like grandma just visited, minus the raisins. It has chocolate flakes though, which have just enough bitterness to them that you're not overwhelmed by the buttery base. Safe to say after my dip into thievery had passed (and I had a 12 hour nap) I went and got my own pint. Sorry girlie! It only happened once I swear.\n",
            "Where have you been all my life? This ice cream is divine.\n",
            "I picked this up from my local grocery store a couple months ago, and WOW!! It is my favorite ice cream I’ve had to date. I can’t stop thinking about it though, after I tried it I haven’t seen it stocked in a store since then, and I literally look EVERY day so I can buy them all up. If it was regularly stocked I would be eating this 3 times a week at least it’s that good. It’s so buttery and perfectly sweet, but the chocolate and cinnamon flavors add the perfect amount of savory to balance everything out. I can’t help but think how awesome it would be with the cookie dough pieces added to it as well if I was feeling really indulgent. I wish I could get my hands on this stuff again.\n",
            "Years ago you abandoned us with the Oatmeal Cookie Chunk stunt. Not cool. But last week I had an out of body experience.... you created Oats of this Swirled!!!! I must admit, I even like it better than my original addiction. I'm proud of you guys for listening. It's so addicting.\n",
            "I really like this flavor idea. I love any ice cream flavor of \"oatmeal cookie\". Honestly the huge chunks of fudge makes me gag . I end up picking them out after 2.... I was expecting a lot more oatmeal cookie. I think it would really be \"Oat of this swirled\" if you added just a bit more oatmeal cookie, took about a 1/4 of the fudge chucks and shaved them instead. That sounds perfect to me. Please alert me when these changes have been implemented. Thanks so much❣\n",
            "I had high hopes for this flavor when I saw it in the freezer case. I thought the brown sugar ice cream base was really good as was the oatmeal cinnamon swirls, but for me it was ruined by the excessive amount of fudge flakes, which to me really aren't flakes but more like chunks. There were just too many that I ended up tasting more of the fudge than anything else and eventually had to eat around them. I think at least half as many fudge flakes could have been used and still served it's purpose. I'd likely only buy it again if I knew there was less flakes in it.\n",
            "I wanted to love this. And.... I like it, but didn't love. Oatmeal Cookie was my all time favorite ice cream before it was pulled, and so I immediately purchased this when I saw this in the store. But, the cookie definitely did not have any of the amazing chunks I was expecting, and to further disappoint, barely had any traces/flavoring swirled in at all. The base was good (and maybe even an improvement on the Oatmeal Cookie!), but it really did not make up for the lack of cookie. Oh Ben and Jerrys, why do you tease me so?!\n",
            "I first came across this flavor in November 2018 and I was instantly hooked. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find in anywhere since and I've traveled across the country, from Washington state to Virginia for the holidays. Not a single pint to be found. I'm desperate!\n",
            "Oatmeal cookie chunk was my all time favorite ice cream, so when I saw oat of this swirled being released I was super excited! Unfortunately it doesn't quite stack up. The flavor is really good but I was disappointed to see that it was just a swirl of cookie (if you can call it that, my pint barely had any) and not more substantial chunks. I miss being able to taste chunks of delicious oatmeal cookies in my ice cream.\n",
            "A nearly perfect pint. There were TONS of fudge chips in this one and the cookie swirl was dense and super yummy. The ice cream didn’t scream ‘buttery brown sugar’ though. It’s really good tasting ice cream and you do get a hint of those flavors but it could have been coming off the cookie swirl as easily. But that’s a small issue and it really is a great tasting pint which I will definitely buy again!\n",
            "I'm eating this right now for the first time, and it's absolutely amazing! It does remind me of the former Oatmeal Cookie Chunk, which was my favorite flavor, but I actually like this one even better. The combination of sweet cinnamon ice cream, delicious oatmeal cookies, and fantastic fudge flakes truly is out of this world! Oat of This Swirled is my absolute new favorite! THANK YOU for bringing back an ice cream with oats! It's phenomenal!!!\n",
            "Literally my favorite flavor ever. I scarfed down a pint of this in one sitting. And I did that multiple times. So sad I’m not seeing it in grocery stores anymore though :(\n",
            "Oatmeal Cookie Chunk was my all time favorite Ben & Jerry's ice cream. Although the flavor of this \"replacement\" is very good, it lacks a much desired cookie dough texture. The \"oatmeal cinnamon cookie swirl\" does not offer a different texture to the regular ice cream. I was pretty bummed, but it does have good flavor... just lacks any cookie texture.\n",
            "I think this is my new favorite flavor!\n",
            "When the Oatmeal Cookie Chunk disappeared without warning it was a sad day for this devoted ice cream lover :( Oh my goodness, although slightly different, it is a delicious reincarnation of my old favorite!! Please don't get rid of this one too Ben and Jerry's :)\n",
            "Last week I purchased “Oat of this Swirled” at my local Safeway in Mill Valley, CA. Wasn’t I disappointed when the ice cream I found inside the container was missing more than half of the ingredients listed in the ice cream’s description. No oatmeal cookie swirl nor buttery brown sugar ice cream. Just a very flat tasting white ice cream with bittersweet chocolate flakes. I’m wondering how many other containers of this flavor are floating around with missing ingredients and whether or not B&J is aware of it? Here are photos that prove I’m not crazy!\n",
            "I tried this because oatmeal is good for nursing mom's in boosting milk production. Well it tastes amazing and i will be eating this regularly. Mmmmm gooooood!!!!\n",
            "It’s really good ice cream, I like it a lot. But I think my boyfriend likes it more.\n",
            "This isn't the normal flavor I buy, for some reason my grocery store was out of the regular flavor so I bought this instead. It was delicious. I ended up putting this on my waffle for an extra treat and OH MY ATLANTA IT WAS GOOD. This flavor was so gooood on a homemade waffle with chocolate chips, it was amazing!!! I was really impressed with this flavor and I have fallen in love! It's a good combo of chocolate to cinnamon. I like that the oat cookies are softer and the chocolate chunks add a very nice crunch!! But I REALLLY recommend putting this on a waffle!!!\n",
            "There are absolutely no swirls of oatmeal cinnamon cookie in this ice cream\n",
            "It's the best of all time. By far I've already are my weight in this flavor\n",
            "This ice cream was an instant NEW favorite of mine! It is nearly as good as it's apparent predecessor, the dearly departed Oatmeal Cookie Chunk! Way to go Ben & Jerry!\n",
            "I love this flavor so much! The base has a lot of tasty cinnamon and I agree with other reviewers that there are a ton of chocolate fudge flakes but I actually like them because they seem to be darker chocolate and they balance all the sweetness and richness of the buttery ice cream and cookie swirl. I also love the texture of the swirl--it's a little gritty (in a good way) and super sweet. All around amazing flavor!\n",
            "I was also a fan of Oatmeal Cookie Chunk but I also agree that this is just slightly better bc of the cinnamon crunch. But there should be cookie dough-like chunks, similar to Cinnamon Buns or Cookie Dough and this would be over the top amazing!\n",
            "Super underrated flavor. Will forever be one of my favorites. Perfect balance\n",
            "I decided to try something new--so glad I did! Might be a new favorite.\n",
            "I tried this one because everyone raved about it, and i wanted to too! it's a good ice cream. it's not bad it's not ohmygosh amazing but it's good. I've recently been obsessed with taste testing ice creams and i'm a cinnamon/spice fan and this flavor reminded me exactly of halotop's oatmeal cookie. like to a T. which one being a kinda \"diet\" icecream and one being a full blown icecream i was sad they were so identical. by all means i'll keep eating it until it's gone, but i just expected something more from my pal's ben and jerry.\n",
            "I just recently cane across this flavor. It did remind me of the punt that had chunks of oatmeal cookie, which was the best cream ever, then it was no longer in stores which sucks. This flavor is good, I just wish there was more of the swirl in it. I love the big chocolate chips. Please do not discontinue this flavor it please bring back the oatmeal chunk flair.\n",
            "Typically when I buy ice cream, I want chocolate. I typically go for Phish Food, or the older Smores flavor, or even the chocolate brownie. I was SO shocked to find that I LOVE this flavor! The brown sugar and oatmeal are just amazing and the chocolate flakes give it enough chocolatey flavor. This is now one of my new favorites and in the top 4 of B&J choices.\n",
            "I pride myself on my oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe. My go-to dessert is often an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie with a tall glass of milk. But when I want ice cream too I'm pushing it. Oat of This Swirled is the answer to my prayers! The brown sugar ice cream base is simply delicious on its own. Sweet and creamy without ever tasting too heavy. The oat taste comes in just afterward with a warm and rich note. The chocolate chips in addition to all this really ties it together. Amazing! Please keep this flavor around!!!\n",
            "This is the best B&J flavor going. If you’ve ever had the Oatmeal Raisin Cookie flavor that no longer exists, you’re in luck. The base of Oat Of This Swirled is very similar. It’s just one of those things where the flavors and textures all come together perfectly in every bite. It’s a scoop of heaven (ok, make mine two scoops)!\n",
            "I am a huge ice cream fan and especially love very intense flavors. I found Oat of This Swirled about a month ago and WOW. This is honestly the greatest ice cream flavor ever. The cookie swirls are very reminiscent of Christmas cookies I’ve made and pair perfectly with the buttery ice cream. 10/10. Dare I say, perfect!\n",
            "I had a friend come and visit from out of town and we went to target to get snacks. We both love ice cream, so we went to the Ben and Jerry’s section to get some. I read “oats” in the grocery store , I immediately walked past it. I grabbed my strawberry cheesecake and kept moving. When we got to my house , she convinced me to try hers. It was so good , and it ended up being this one! I have bought it about 5 times since December! The flavors compliment each other well. On the sweeter side, but worth every bite!\n",
            "I bought this flavor initially because I had read it helped with mil production while breastfeeding. I was instantly hooked! They don’t carry it in my grocery stores, but I am surrounded by Targets and Walmart’s that NEVER have it in stock anymore. Where have you gone??? Come back!\n",
            "We bought various flavors for our small wedding this past weekend, and I grabbed the Oat of This Swirled for my personal stash. It was so good, my Maid of Honor and I ate the entire pint while decorating. Typically not something a Bride wants to do the day before her wedding, but I couldn't put it down. It was delicious. I'm not a big chocolate chunk fan, but I push them to the side and dig for the swirls. This is by far the BEST ice cream I've ever had. Definitely worth a taste!!!\n",
            "Oatmeal Chocolate Chunk was my favorite ice cream ever. I was so devastated when it went to the Flavor Graveyard (RIP). Now this. THIS ice cream is unreal and even better than its predecessor. The brown sugar and cinnamon make it. I have nothing bad to say about this ice cream, although more oatmeal cookie chunks never hurt anymore. I crave this ice cream and I hope it never makes it to the Flavor Graveyard! Viva Oat of This Swirled.\n",
            "I read on Pinterest that this ice cream could increase milk supply for breastfeeding so I thought I’d try it as I’ve had low supply issues. It didn’t work for that but it did work for getting me hooked on a new ice cream. This stuff is delicious and I can’t stop eating it. I’ve never been a big Ben and Jerry’s fan (mostly because I thought it was overpriced and just didn’t buy it) but I’ve splurged too many times buying this stuff. I love the combination of flavors in this ice cream. It’s so delicious!\n",
            "I have probably eaten at least 11 pints of this! It tastes exactly like an oatmeal cookie with just the right amount of chocolate! It is definitely a comfort treat and the best flavor Ben & Jerry's makes! I hope it stays forever!\n",
            "I bought this flavor a month ago because it reminded me of my all-time favorite oatmeal cookie chunk. My heart was broken when I found out that that flavor in a longer existed. After trying this flavor I definitely had flashbacks to the good days! Love the flavors. Wish I could get everywhere but still limited ( at least in New York City). Thank you Ben & Jerry’s for this flavor! I hope one day oatmeal cookie chunk comes back, but until then this definitely will stay stocked in my freezer.\n",
            "I need to preface by stating that I have never tried B&J's Oatmeal Cookie Chunk, so I have no idea how this flavor compares to it's ancestor. That said, if OCC tasted anything like Oat of this Swirled, NO WONDER fans have been begging for its return for so long. This flavor is absolutely delicious! The swirl perfectly captures that baked cinnamon and oat taste you'd expect from the cookie but without any oats as far as I can tell. The buttery brown sugar base, which has always been one of B&J's best, perfectly compliments the swirl, cementing the cookie theme in taste. And the fudge flakes, while a bit strong, add a nice contrast.\n",
            "I miss the Oatmeal Cookie Chunk flavor that was discontinued. I heard about this being a close replacement but it most definitely is not. I like the cinnamon, I like the chocolate chunks, but I miss the oatmeal cookie bits, and despise what they've done with the brown sugar. It kind of melts and sticks to the ice-cream creating this texture that reminds me of cookie dough. This is at something I never enjoyed. And the flavor is kind of like a butter-scotch. Also not for me. What is 'for me' is gone; The oatmeal cookie without any of this gooey gross stuff that reminds me of every other gimmicky approach Ben and Jerry's takes with their icecream. I may be in the minority but the only flavor they ever made that I like is gone. My taste buds may be in a minority but that is the way the cookie crumbles.\n",
            "I literally ate this stuff for dinner. It's absolutely amazing and so satisfying. I was glad there were pieces of dark chocolate rather than fudge swirls. That made it so much better.\n",
            "I almost never leave reviews but for this I had to. I've never had the original flavor others are talking about, but within the first few bites of this it instantly became my favorite ben & jerry's flavor. I don't know if I picked a good pint or they've improved it, but the swirl was perfect from top to bottom and the brown sugar base is yummy. While the chocolate flakes are small, I think if they were half the current size they would be even better. Other than that it's delicious!!\n",
            "I've read the reviews of others and like everyone else Oatmeal Cookie Chunk was my favorite ice cream ever... I appreciate the close second of this one but I miss the cinnamon base ice cream and the more present oatmeal cookie from the best one. I disagree with the less chocolate chunks though. I just think adding more cinnamon oatmeal cookie would balance it out to be a new favorite for all oatmeal cookie chunk lovers.\n",
            "I think the ratio of chocolate chunk to oatmeal is just right. The cinnamon ice cream base is flavorful, but not too heavy. I can't buy enough of these pints!\n",
            "I usually don't eat Ben and Jerry's ice cream, but this flavor intrigued me. And it did not disappoint!!! It is sooooo good, it has become my new favorite!\n",
            "This has to be my favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor yet. It's bursting with flavor that sends me rushing to when I was a kid after school sneakin' oatmeal cookies in my room to snack on! Definitely nostalgic in the most perfect way. The only negative thing I do have to say about it though is like a few people have stated already, the chocolate chunks are BIG. Some people enjoy that, but I feel like it upstages the oatmeal cookie. I want more of that than the chocolate. Thank you!!!\n",
            "Amazing oatmeal cookie tasting ice cream, smooth and creamy, with generously sized chunks of chocolate. Hands down best flavor.\n",
            "tried this ice cream once and i hardly ever buy another pint. the oat swirls are so good, it’s literally the perfect ice cream.\n",
            "In the pandemic, my husband and I have been systematically trying all your ice creams- this is THE BEST!!\n",
            "This is honestly the best flavor I have ever had. It is amazing but not overwhelming sweet.\n",
            "Oatmeal Cookie by far was my absolute favorite ice cream of all times! I was in tears when it mysteriously disappeared out of grocery store freezers. But low and behold, dog on Ben & Jerry’s does it again! Oat of this Swirled is a taste from heaven above! I would say, however my last purchase had way too many fudge flakes for my liking but I just ate around them... I agree with the other reviewers would definitely like more cookie crunch! Nonetheless, thumbs up B&J!\n",
            "It took every inch of my will power not to eat the entire container in one sitting.\n",
            "This is my second favorite B&J flavor. Its creamy delciousness is not too cinnamon-y, which was the only thing holding my back from choosing this over cherry garcia. The chocolate chunks are large which matters a lot as well and the oats are the perfect consistency-- not grainy and chalk like. I'm so impressed with the geniousness of this flavor. It's superb and rich enough to enjoy but not so rich that you'll be doubled over in sugar agony. Absolutely wonderful.\n",
            "My favorite flavor growing up and now I can enjoy it once again\n",
            "LOVE THIS FLAVOR. PLZ NEVER DISCONTINUE THIS FLAVOR.\n",
            "Went away from my favorites of the Cinnabon one, the Milk & Cookies one, and the best one ever - the new Truffle Kerfruffle one (personal fav). Very disappointed in my decision, as this one tasted sort of bland. I mean the brown sugar flavor was good dont get me wrong, but I guess I'm used to chunks, lots of them (like the Kefruffle one), the swirl just doesn't do it and it isn't enough. Glad I tried it though so I know, but back to the Kefruffle one!!!\n",
            "This is absolutely my favorite ice cream from Ben & Jerry's!! After I had my last son 2 weeks early and my milk was not yet in, I gave this ice cream a try from what others had said about it and it definitely help my milk come in. I ate it just about everyday the first week and my milk supply came in more then with my first son. Unfortunately the Walmart I get it from is always out, now! This stuff is so amazing it's gone before you know it.\n",
            "When my girlfriend and I saw this we couldn't have been more excited to purchase! Her favorite B+J's ice cream was the oatmeal cookie crunch and this was so so so good. I agree with other people on maybe more oatmeal cookie/swirls inside but I can't get enough of this ice cream. It's incredibly dangerous to have in the freezer! Thank you for a great ice cream that we'll be purchasing -- and please don't put this in the graveyard!\n",
            "Wasn’t sure about it when i first bought it....but then fell in love. Absolutely my favorite so far! But HARD to find now!! I was devastated when brownie batter disappeared and had not found another one I liked as much. I see people talking about an oatmeal cookie one that was made??? I missed that one. Maybe it will come out again. But love this flavor. Just hard to find. Like the elusive lochness monster. Lol.\n",
            "I was so excited to see an oatmeal cookie ice cream, my fave!! But although the name starts with \"Oat,\" there's barely anything oat about it. In a blind taste test, I would say it's a chocolate chunk in a creamy vanilla base with a hint of cinnamon and caramel. I can not detect any oatmeal cookies. I wanted to love it; I am 90-95% dairy-free but made an exception for this. Won't eat the rest of the pint.\n",
            "I bought a pint a week after I broke my arm. Even after 10 sequential pints this flavor doesn't get old. I must admit I even ate it for breakfast. The only disappointing aspect of this product is the lack of its presence on my local grocery stores' shelves. My arm healed quickly and is now strong, I accredit this to the hope packaged in a pint. Thank you from my past, present, and future self.\n",
            "I've never had an ice cream that I was so excited about or was my go to flavor. Since trying oat of this swirled, I have found my favorite flavor. I love the slight caramel flavor of the ice cream, and the chocolate chunks that perfectly balance the cinnamon cookie swirl. The only crunch I got was from the chocolate chunks, which was the perfect balance of crunchy and creamy. Soo good!!\n",
            "Greatness was popularized with the takeover of overnight Oats. Oats and Oatmeal cookies have always been a favorite of mine, but have been scoffed at for most of my life. THey have typically been thought of as Grandma cookies because they likely contain raisin. Ben & Jerry's did this cookie justice by adding large chocolate chunks and capitalizing on the cookies brown sugary goodness.\n",
            "I was obsessed, absolutely obsessed with the oatmeal cookie chunk, and Oat of this swirled has nearly mended my broken oatmeal/cinnamon loving heart. I've had this 4 or 5 times now and there's hardly much of a cookie swirl at all. Maybe I'm just having bad luck, but mine have had little to no cookie. You really need to beef it up, and this flavor would truly be out of this world!!\n",
            "I stumbled upon the Oatmeal Cookie Crumble or Crunch and was so sad when it randomly disappeared. I've been looking here and there to see if they brought it back. I found this yesterday while at Target and my heart smiled. It's yummy! Would love more oatmeal cookie pieces but overall I love it. I'm going to buy more. So if you'd like to bring back the original that would be GREAT to.\n",
            "Oat of this swirled is seriously out of this world! This is my favorite ice cream of all time. The abundance of snappy chocolate flakes! And the oaty, cinnamony swirls! YUM! I just wish this was carried in more stores! Luckily they've been stocking it at my nearby Star Market in Somerville, MA, but I have yet to see it in any corner stores or drug stores. I'm a forever fan!\n",
            "So, years ago another ice cream brand made a flavor called Oatmeal Cookie. You could only get it in their ice cream shops (at least where I live) and I was obsessed with it. Sadly it disappeared around 2014. When I saw this in stores, I got excited because it sounded like the same ice cram and it pretty much is. It is sooooo good. Please don't even stop making this flavor.\n",
            "There's just too many chocolate chunks in this ice cream it tends to overpower the ice cream itself. It needs more of the cookie bits instead. Also, how about raisins?\n",
            "I like this ice cream and it's close to my all time favorite oatmeal cookie chunk. Everytime I go to the store I go to the ice cream isle hopefully to find the best ice cream of all time, oatmeal cookie chunk. I've been doing this since Ben and Jerry's stop making it. I just wish you guys would stop messing with my ice cream emotions and make oatmeal cookie chunk again.\n",
            "I bought this at Wawa and when I saw it had oatmeal cookie dough in it I HAD to try it. I'm an oatmeal cookie monster, its my favorite! and this flavor hits it on the head!! The brown sugar ice cream and the mixture of oatmeal cookie dough and then to top it with the chocolate chips.... literally amazing!! I hope this flavor doesn't go anywhere because this is delish!!\n",
            "I love this flavor so much. Everything is in perfect harmony. I'm very picky with ice cream flavors, but I'm a huge fan of brown sugar and I love how it's incorporated into this flavor. \"Oat of This Swirled\" really is out of this world.... It's heavenly! I'm hoping the grocery store keeps selling this flavor forever because I plan on buying it over and over again.\n",
            "It's a great flavor! I love it! BUT THOSE MASSIVE CHOCOLATE PIECES DRIVE ME CRAZY!!!! I've never had an oatmeal cookie with chocolate in it and don't like the combo. I pick them out. I like chocolate....I like oatmeal cookie but not together!\n",
            "I was craving ice cream but B&J's was pretty much wiped out at my local grocery store. This was one of the only flavors left, but it's not something I'd typically go for. I got it anyway and oh my goodness, I'm so glad I did!!! It is so delicious, from the flavor of the brown sugar ice cream to the chocolate and cookie swirls. Will definitely purchase again.\n",
            "Amazing ice cream, real creamy and buttery, love the oatmeal cookie added in. Best flavor in my opinion... One thing I suggest is not adding so many chocolate chip chunks, it kind of got in the way of the brown sugar buttery oatmeal cookies ice cream I was trying to enjoy. Eventually started picking them out of the ice cream, other than that, great flavor\n",
            "I went looking for the new bob Marley flavor and found this one! I couldn't believe that you brought something back similar to oatmeal cookie chunk. Even though that flavor was retired, I still went looking for it. Made my trip to the jersey shore worth it today! Posted it on Facebook right away. Brought me back to when my husband and I dated, love it!\n",
            "This miraculous flavor has the ability to get you a significant other, ace your exams, water your crops, clear your acne, do your chores, call up your distant relatives and tell them how much you love them (because you don't do it as often as they would like), give you 20/20 vision and bless your soul... There is nothing Oat of this Swirled cannot do.\n",
            "I recently had my wisdom teeth out and when ice cream was an approved food, I went straight to the store. I bought this because I just to love the Oatmeal Cookie flavor Ben and Jerry's used to have and holy smokes is this amazing. Please make this a permanent flavor because I'm not sure how long I can make the four pints last! So tasty! I'm in love!\n",
            "I've never had the flavor I keep seeing everyone compare this to, so I can't make a comparison. However, I think this has quickly become my new favorite flavor, and I've been a ride or die for Cherry Garcia for half my life. The buttery brown sugar ice cream part is the perfect background for the chunks of chocolate and swirls of sweet cinnamon\n",
            "I can’t stop eating this ice cream. As a former scooper, I would think I would get sick of it but nope I keep coming back for more. I do agree with the earlier reviewers suggestion - more cookie swirl less chocolate chunks. The chunks are quite large and overwhelm the taste of the ice cream and the cookie mix. It hasn’t stopped me yet though.\n",
            "I wasn’t looking to try a new flavor but this one peaked my taste buds and oh my gosh, so good, so perfectly blended. I saw a lot of complaints about too much chocolate but I love the bitterness and crunch of the chocolate. It balances out the sweet cinnamon and brown sugar. Overall one of the best flavors! Creamy, crunchy and sweet!\n",
            "I’ve tried many flavors but this one by far is the best. I personally think there needs to be a little more cookie pieces but don’t overdo it all of the components complement each other so well. I hope this ice cream stays as a “forever flavor”. Everybody loves it so much it’s the first flavor to sell out in my town in all stores. ❤️\n",
            "Sometimes it takes losing something to know how much you loved it. Tragically, all the local grocery stores ran out of this flavor. It’s been three weeks now! It pains me to open my freezer and see the empty slot where Oat of This Swirled used to sit. Please, don’t take this flavor for granted. Enjoy every bite like it’s your last.\n",
            "I bought this because of course, I am always down to try new flavors from B&J. I loved this ice cream with all of my heart, and I really hope it is here to stay forever! This ice cream is a definite favorite due to my love for oatmeal cookies, and it actually tasted like the oatmeal cookie dough and an actual cookie!!! Love it :)\n",
            "I tried Oat of this Swirled this weekend and really enjoyed it! The brown sugar base was delicious and such a unique flavor. However, I was disappointed by the large amount of chocolate flakes versus actual oatmeal cinnamon cookies. It made the overall flavor more chocolatey than the cinnamon/brown sugar flavor I was hoping for.\n",
            "I love this flavor! I loved the Oatmeal cookie chunk flavor that they discontinued awhile back and was always so sad they got rid of it. When I saw this flavor and knew it was a lot like the old one I was so happy!!! My husband and I love it and can't put the tub down till it's empty haha please never get rid of this flavor!\n",
            "Oat of this Swirled has all the elements . . . it's got those classic B&J chocolate chunks, it's got those perfect cookie bites, it's got a nice, subtle, creamy base, it's got swirls of sugary deliciousness. I LOVE THIS FLAVOR! It's unseated Chunky Monkey after maybe half a decade as my FAVORITE OF THEM ALL!\n",
            "There is barely any oatmeal cookie in this ice cream which is really disappointing since Ben and Jerry’s always has lots of good stuff in their ice cream. There are WAY TO many big pieces of fudge flakes. I was so upset I MADE MY OWN OATMEAL COOKIES TO SWIRL IN!!! When you do get a rare piece of cookie it is good.\n",
            "It is my favorite ice cream flavor of all time. BUT I do think that there needs to be more oatmeal cookie chunks and less fudge chips - or at least make the fudge chips smaller. Definitely more cookie chunks though! But it is delicious and if you ever stop making it.. I. WILL. NEVER. FORGIVE. YOU. BEN. & JERRY. :)\n",
            "A die-hard half-baked fan, i have seen the light. If Jesus got bored with plants and animals and peoples and decided to make an ice cream, it would be brown sugar. Beyoncé named the twins after this flavor. This was Victoria's Secret. I don't even like Oats and this ice cream still gave me a reason to live. Amen.\n",
            "I just bought this because I like the idea of oatmeal cookies in ice cream, but every spoonful was just fudge flakes. The ice cream itself is very good, but there are simply too many fudge flakes. I can understand putting a few in for texture, but this just made the ice cream too crunchy and was a disappointment.\n",
            "This ice cream tastes like someone took an oatmeal cookie and made it into ice cream without being overbearing with the oatmeal or the cinnamon. Then, just for fun, they put chocolate in it.\n",
            "I am loving this flavor so much: the oatmeal cookie chunks paired with the slabs of chocolate are just perfect. Is this flavor being discontinued? I am not able to find it as much as I used to be able to!\n",
            "I have never sat on the couch and ate ice cream before but after sampling this flavor that's exactly what I was doing 2 days later. I love this! I've bought it 3 different times now. Each time it's a bit of a surprise to see what the fudge flake to cookie swirl ratio is and I kind of enjoy that.\n",
            "Never sure what flavor I want to get when in the mood for ice cream, but I enjoy new things. I was extremely surprised at how delicious this one was! Over the past several months, this has been my go to flavor! If you're unsure, go ahead and give it a try. You might be as surprised as I was.\n",
            "This is hands down the best ice cream flavor Ben & Jerry's has. The oat meal cookie dough swirls with chocolate chunks mixed with the brown sugar ice cream makes for an unbeatable combination. This is like everything I love wrapped up in an ice cream flavor! Please say this is here to stay!\n",
            "I absolutely loved the Ben and Jerry's Oatmeal Cookie Chunk ice cream. Definitely the best flavor of all time! I'm so glad there's finally a replacement. Oat of This Swirled is so close to the old flavor and does not disappoint. Happy to say I've finally got my favorite ice cream back!\n",
            "What happened? This flavor is nowhere to be found. I checked the locator and no stock is found within a 100 mile radius. I live in a big city so this is kind of ridiculous! Please start stocking this flavor again! It was bad enough that you had to discontinue Oatmeal Cookie Chunk.\n",
            "Oh My Lanta!! This flavor is beyond amazing... I was absolutely and pleasantly surprised at how delicious this ice cream ended up tasting. The buttery flavor DEFINITELY comes through in this, and the chocolate and oatmeal bits are just the cherry on top! LOVE THIS ONE!\n",
            "I ate this icecream like every other day when I was breast feeding my son it helped with my milk supply and was super tasty but I haven't been able to find it anywhere for like a year now and I'm so upset please bring it back to my stores in Wilmington or hampstead\n",
            "All in all an oat-standing flavor that meets the need I didn't know I had for oats in ice cream. Even my roommate with impossibly high ice cream standards said this might be one of her favorite Ben & Jerry's flavors! I just wish there was twice as much swirl!\n",
            "I bought this flavor because I wanted to try something new and I am so happy I did! This is now my favorite flavor because it is a mixture of all the things I love! I hope this flavor stays around because if it does not I do not know how I will finish collge.\n",
            "This was by far my favorite Ben and Jerry's flavor. I usually have my few favorites and keep to them, but once I tried this, my mind was literally blown! I don't see this flavor around much anymore, but I'm hoping they keep making more of these!!!\n",
            "I breastfeed my daughter and was told by a couple different people that eating this flavor of Ben and Jerry’s would help boost my milk supply, so I decided to try it out and it definitely works! The flavor is amazing as well! Super addicting!\n",
            "I tried this in scoop shop and loved it spring 2017. Bought a pint and brought it home. My son saw it , tried it, finished it. So I bought another pint. My wife saw it, tried it , finished it. Had to buy more just so I could have some!\n",
            "This has to be one of my favorite flavors. The fudge chunks and oatmeal cookie swirls just go so good together. I never tried Oatmeal Cookie Chunk so I can't say how it compares but I can't stop coming back to this one. Good job B&J :)\n",
            "This is the best of the new flavors! It's so creamy and lip-smacking sweet, and the flavor and integrity of the cookie swirl is divine. My usual favorite is Chunky Monkey, but I will be picking up Oat of this Swirled a lot more often!\n",
            "Melted in my mouth like the real thing. My boyfriend and I both love oatmeal cookies, and accordingly, both loved this flavor. The cinnamon & cookie swirls were fabulous, and the chocolate shards were plentiful. Great product.\n",
            "I would rate this higher if you would remove or reduce the chocolate flakes!! No need for chocolate flakes when there is so much other great flavor going on. It is too much with the extra chocolate. Sometimes less is more.\n",
            "My favorite flavor was Oatmeal Cookie Chunk and was disappointed when it made it to the Graveyard. I was beyond excited when I saw Oat of This Swirled. Thank you, thank you, thank you\n",
            "for bringing it back!!!\n",
            "I wished I had bought this by the case before it disappeared last time. So happy its back! I'll be stocking up just in case. It's a change from my usual chocolate favorites, cinnamony, with the chew oatmeal cookie- so good!\n",
            "You played with my heart! I was hoping this would compare to the discontinued Oatmeal cookie Chunk but...... IT DID'NT. Please please bring back the Oatmeal cookie Chunk flavor, you will make millions of people so happy.\n",
            "I'm typically just a chocolate person, and would never even look at an Oatmeal flavor. However my friend got this flavor and I hate more of her pint than she did. It is beyond delicious! I turn all of my friends onto it.\n",
            "Bought this flavor yesterday and I do agree with the other reviewers that are saying it needs more oatmeal cinnamon cookie swirl and less fudge flakes. Glad I'm not the only one thinking this. However I will buy again.\n",
            "There was a lot of hype for this flavor being similar to oatmeal cookie chunk\n",
            "The base brown sugar ice cream is kind of like a milder vanilla. It's decent, but there are many ben and jerrys flavors that are better!\n",
            "I LOVED the now dead Oatmeal Cookie Chunk, so I was hoping this flavor would be similar. It is very yummy, and I love the flavor combo... But it isn’t as amazing and delicious as OCC. I still really like it though.\n",
            "The mix ins are amazing I love the dough and the fudge flakes but the flavors of the ice cream was bland. Vanilla has a stronger flavor. Added cinnamon to it and it was AMAZING but sad I had to alter it at all\n",
            "For years, my \"go to\" has been Cherry Garcia. And then out of the blue I decided to try Oat of This Swirled. I'm so glad I did! I do believe this is my new favorite! Well done B&J....well done. And thank you!\n",
            "I love this flavor stumbled upon this while staring blankly in the freezer section. The taste us rich and comforting, tastes like my grandmothers homemake ice cream and cookies in the summer time. Thank you\n",
            "I'm not a fan of chocolate based flavors so was happy to try this one. It's pretty good. I was hoping for more oatmeal cookie taste and more vanilla tasting ice cream and less cinnamon. Still good though.\n",
            "I was excited when I saw this in the store yesterday! It is very close to my all time favorite, \"Oatmeal Cookie Chunk\", that was discontinued years ago; however, it definitely needs more oatmeal cookie!\n",
            "Thank you, thank you. My absolute favorite was always oatmeal cookie dough chunk and then it was gone. No warning. Just gone. This is it, slightly different but so very delightfully similar. Love it!\n",
            "F A V O R I T E! I always get the same flavor all the time but this once I go out on a limb and get this flavor and now I am embarking on a journey to try all different flavors! AH-MAZ-ING! sa good.\n",
            "This might be one of the worst ice cream flavors I've ever had. So disappointed. Totally bombarded by cinnamon. I was hoping for more of an oatmeal cookie, and it just tasted like not good cinnamon.\n",
            "My boyfriend is amazing but very basic when it comes to ice cream, and always forces me to get Phish Food or Half Baked when we get ice cream. FINALLY we got something new and it was pretty great.\n",
            "I bought this on a whim to try something new and it has changed my life! Occasionally it's out of stock at my store and panic ensues. Please don't ever leave me! The cinnamon swirl is to die for!\n",
            "I was so excited to see oatmeal cookie Ben and Jerry’s but was very disappointed with this. The flavor of the ice cream was good but there was no oatmeal cookie and way too many chocolate chunks.\n",
            "I've been searching for the perfect ice cream and this is it. Love the brown sugar, cinnamon, and semisweet dark chocolate. Not too sweet & perfectly textured. Please don't ever discontinue it!\n",
            "I wish this flavor had actual oatmeal cookie chunks as stated in the description on the pint. Also, the ice cream base tastes like vanilla, not \"buttery brown sugar\". It is still yummy though.\n",
            "This is a great flavor, however, there’s not enough oatmeal cookie swirl especially in comparison to the overwhelming amount of fudge flakes. Did anyone sample this before it was brought back?\n",
            "This reminds me of an old ben and jerrys flavor that instead had cinnamon ice cream with oatmeal chunks that I used to get all the time and absolutely loved! This one is now my new favorite.\n",
            "I was hesitant to buy but lucky I did. I thought it would have been a hardcore oatmeal taste but I was pleasantly surprised it wasn't . It is now in my top 5 or maybe top 3. It's a must try\n",
            "This caught my eye this week at the store and I picked it up. It is absolutely delicious. I wish the cookie chunks were a little bigger but the flavor is amazing. Definitely a new favorite!\n",
            "I too was hoping for something close to Oatmeal Cookie Chunk and was pleasantly surprised. It's my new go to ... but nothing will replace OCK as the all time favorite!!! #pleasebringitback\n",
            "Tastes like a fresh baked oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. The brown sugar ice cream is to die for. It is perfectly sweet and cinnamony. Bliss in every bite. Please never stop making this.\n",
            "Not usually a huge oatmeal cookie fan, but combined with the brown sugar base and fudge flakes, Oat of This Swirled is very very good and surprisingly one of my favorite flavors of B&J.\n",
            "please please please dont ever stop making this favor. Started eating this after a had my son to help me with breastfeeding...it works!! But what really did it was the taste is amazing.\n",
            "A must try. The flavor of the brown sugar ice cream is to die for. Pair it with that sugar swirl and chocolate chunks and it'll win over your heart. Definitely a new favorite of mine!!!\n",
            "Delish- there is no doubt but I still miss my all time favorite oatmeal cookie chunk!!!!! Is it possible to believe it will be brought back from the flavor graveyard?!? Please say yes!\n",
            "I'm really quite embarrassed to say how much ive bought since giving birth. Went to Wal-Mart and they didn't have it i was so dissapointed. I hope you always keep THIS FLAVOR PLEASE\n",
            "I thank you for bring back my \"Oatmeal cookie chunk\" in a different name \"Oat of theswirled.\" I have been waiting on this flavor for years after several request on this same website!\n",
            "I tried this a week ago and OMG this is my favorite ice cream flavor. I never had something so addicting. I am not so proud top say i have had this everyday for the past 7 days.\n",
            "It is very good I love that buttery, creamy, cinnamon that is in Ben and jerries, I must say I like Ben and Jerry’s Cinnamon buns ice cream a little better but this is still good!\n",
            "Tried this two days ago!! It is amazing. Usually I prefer chocolate above all others but this one knocks everything else out. The dirt spoonful reminded me of Christmas. Love it!!\n",
            "I was an oatmeal cookie chunk addict so was very excited to see this today!! It is excellent but very little oatmeal, I would love to see bigger chunks of oatmeal in the future!!\n",
            "No combination of this anywhere and it is amazing!! The chocolate chunks add a nice crunch texture and the oatmeal flavor is heavenly!! My favorite, thank you Ben and Jerry’s!\n",
            "It is seriously so good. Tastes just like Mexican fried ice cream in my opinion. The brown sugar base ice cream is pure deliciousness. Please never get rid of this flavor!!!\n",
            "My absolute favorite flavor! The swirls of brown sugar make my heart swoon. I’d like it even more with smaller chocolate chunks but will continue buying over and over again.\n",
            "I love this flavor. It's basically like an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie dough mixed in with vanilla ice cream. Put this on top of a waffle, and you got heaven girl friend.\n",
            "This flavor is amazing. The brown sugar ice cream is beautiful and the chocolate chunks have just the right crunch to them. Needs more oat cookie swirl! It's the best part!\n",
            "I've been a fan for a long time and am always trying the latest new flavors. This by far tops the any of the classics. . This hits the sweet tooth just right. Delishhhhhh!\n",
            "Helps increase supply tremendously because of the oats , and tastes absolutely amazing. What more could you want during that 4 am feeding session. Wish it came in gallons\n",
            "I usually don't get anything besides my favorite Coffee Coffee buzz buzz buzz but I love oat anything so I decided to give it a try. This is delicious!!! 10/10 recommend!\n",
            "Ever since I discovered this flavor I haven’t bought another one. It’s my absolute favorite. If the store doesn’t have this flavor or One Love I usually skip ice cream.\n",
            "This is like you brought back Oatmeal Cookie Chunk, the best Ben & Jerry's flavor! You have no idea how happy I am now. Thank you, Thank you.\n",
            "Im not a big fan of icecream until I cam across the flavor. I'm wondering where this particular flavor of icecream has been in all my life. Good work Ben and Jerrys !\n",
            "Love everything about this ice cream BUT I wish it had some bits of chewy oatmeal cookie in it. I think it would really elevate the ice cream experience over the top.\n",
            "I bought this for the first time last night. It has good flavor. I would like to see it have a little more of the oatmeal cookie but I do like the chocolate flakes!\n",
            "LOVED the Oatmeal Cookie Chunk flavor.\n",
            "Was beyond excited when I saw this one. Great Ice cream NOT EVEN CLOSE to enough oatmeal cookie though. Beef it up please!\n",
            "I stumbled upon this ice cream while having a chocolate craving and decided against the chocolate and man was I so happy I did!! It was like a party in my mouth!\n",
            "This ice cream is SO DELISH. I do echo the other reviews asking for more cookie goodness, that cinnamony crunchy stuff is addictive!! Please more cookie crunch!\n",
            "To this day I miss Oatmeal Cookie Chunk, and while this new incarnation is something slightly different it's still very much the flavor I loved and missed!\n",
            "I can’t get enough of this ice cream! Ever since I first tried it I am head over heels. It will be my go-to flavor until I find something better than this.\n",
            "Uhhh my biggest weakness is ice cream and this is my favorite EVER!!! Wish it was easier to find!!! Nothing i could complain about and nothing compares!!\n",
            "I've been craving Ben & Jerry's Oatmeal cookie ice cream ever since it went off the market a few years ago. This new flavor hits the spot. Must try!!!!!\n",
            "This happens to be my favorite ice cream from Ben and jerrys! It taste exactly like brown sugar and oatmeal raisin cookies. Definitely worth the money!\n",
            "I bought this ice cream and I fell in love. The brown sugar ice cream with the oatmeal cookie dough was a perfect combo. It was gone in 2 sittings.\n",
            "This is probably one of the most amazing flavors out there! The perfect combination of oatmeal and cinnamon!!! Pregnancy cravings 100% satisfies!!!\n",
            "Delicious flavor....love this combo, except the waxy chocolate. Salted caramel with the oatmeal cookie dough....that would hit it out of the park.\n",
            "This stuff is great. Chocolate chip oatmeal cookie flavor! They even left out the nasty raisins that have ruined oatmeal cookies for SO LONG!\n",
            "This is now mine and my husbands favorite flavor. I wish it had less chocolate chunks and more cinnamon cookie, but PLEASE DON'T DISCONTINUE IT!\n",
            "Every time I find this in the store I buy at least 3 to have in stock! It is the BEST B&J flavor out there! Please keep it around forever!!!\n",
            "I don't eat much ice cream, but this flavor has me hooked. Don't change a thing about it! AND I'm happy to see it always in stock at my store.\n",
            "This ice cream is perfect. It's my favorite. It's all I can think about when it's in my freezer. Great job Ben & Jerrys! This is a home run.\n",
            "I’m normally a big fan but the fudge was to much and I couldn’t find any oats just brown sugar. The brown sugar was very over powering.\n",
            "If you loved the oatmeal cookie chunk like I did, you'll love this ice cream! It's everything I want in a pint of ice cream and more.\n",
            "Wow, cookies and ice cream, such a great combo. Even better is to make toll house cookies and put the ice cream between two cookies!\n",
            "I have had so many pints of this! It’s soooo good! Unfortunately I can’t find it at my local Walmart anymore. I will keep searching!\n",
            "Im so happy i tried this flavor. it tastes incredible! so cinnamony & creamy. i 100% recommend it if you're into cinnamony things!!\n",
            "This used to be my first favorite ice cream until they came out with the s'mores limited edition. I would switch between the two.\n",
            "I bought this yesterday hoping it would be like the Oatmeal cookie one you had before. Not quite the same but I really loved it!\n",
            "It's the best! I'm currently breast feeding and it increases my supply!! Benefits the baby and mommy gets the best treat ever!!\n",
            "Bought it to try, and it was soo delicious!!! I loved the oat taste and it came through beautifully with the brown sugar. Yum!\n",
            "MY FAVORITE FLAVOR!!! IF YOU HAVE NEVER TRIED IT GIVE IT A CHANCE, I DON'T LIKE OATMEAL COOKIES BUT THIS ICE CREAM IS AMAZING\n",
            "The Oatmeal part is sensational. The only thing I don’t like is the chocolate chips. The ice cream really can do without that\n",
            "I absolutely LOVE this and hoard it every time I find it. Just wish it was in more stores near me! It’s perfect!!! :) :) :)\n",
            "I was so sad when oatmeal cookie chunk was taken from my world. Now I am the happiest person ever, my world is complete!\n",
            "Brown sugar, cinnamon and oatmeal, What a combo! With the success of Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough this just made sense.\n",
            "This was absolute bliss. I literally told everyone l talked to the next day after trying it that it was a life changer.\n",
            "My life is so much better with Oat of this Swirled in it! I’m quite the ice cream snob but this right here....heaven!\n",
            "This is the perfect balance of ice cream, oatmeal, and chocolate. I wish I could find more stores that carried it.\n",
            "Best Flavor of ice cream I've ever Had!! over all the brand's! #nevergetridofit #icecreamhevan #toogoodtobetrue\n",
            "This is the absolute best Ben&Jerry’s ice cream flavor ever! Great do people who love cinnamon and chocolate. :)\n",
            "Perfect combo of my favorite swirl from Oatmeal cookie mixed with large chunks of chocolate chip! I'm obsessed!\n",
            "100% to die for. This beats my old favorites by a landslide. This is dang terrific. Its perfect. Im salivating.\n",
            "I bought a pint and there is a large hole in the bottom I’m disappointed because I didn’t get the full product\n",
            "Oat of the Swirled is a wonderful flavor! The chocolate chunks are perfect...please don't change the formula!\n",
            "Please Please Please keep this one. I am totally addicted to it. Just the right balance of all the flavors.\n",
            "This may just be the perfect ice cream!! I'm so glad I took a chance and tried it, what a great combination!\n",
            "Vanilla ice cream swirled with light cinnamon and fudge flakes. That is all it is. Mad I spent $5 on this.\n",
            "I bought this for the first time yesterday. I want to marry this ice cream. Holy Moly, it is delicious!\n",
            "This was my first experience with trying Ben & Jerrys ice cream and I am totally addicted to this flavor\n",
            "When Oatmeal Cookie Chunk was taken away I was devastated! I am so happy it's sort of \"back\" in a way!\n",
            "Not bad. Please, less fudge flakes and a bit more cinnamon cookie swirl. It would be a perfect pint.\n",
            "Everything about Oats of This Swirled is right. I have a hard time not eating an entire pint at once.\n",
            "Yum yum yum!!! Best flavor ever. Have only bought four so far, (lol) but I'll be back for much\n",
            "Nore\n",
            "Literally the best ice cream I've had in ages! Why is this not in every grocery store (YET)???\n",
            "Im usually skeptical of new flavors but the description was too good to pass up. And i love it\n",
            "I bought it last night and then had a dream about it when I went to sleep. Sooooo delicious!\n",
            "This Ice cream flavor is what gets me through my bad weeks and honestly just makes me happy!\n",
            "It’s the only flavor I’ll eat from Ben & Jerry’s and I can’t seem to find it anymore in NYC\n",
            "I tried this today and it is my new favorite! Odd combination but the result is delicious!\n",
            "This is probably my new favorite flavor. It has great flavor throughout and was so good.\n",
            "This is my absolute favorite ice cream! I could eat it everyday and never get enough!!\n",
            "So good! Like a delicious oatmeal cookie fresh from the oven- but in an ice cream.\n",
            "My husband and I can’t get enough of this flavor it’s definitely our favorite one.\n",
            "Love this new flavor! Reminds me of the old oatmeal cookie which I still miss!!\n",
            "This is the most amazing Ben and Jerry's ever. Please never stop making this!\n",
            "Omg the best flavor ever. Will be so disappointed if it’s ever discontinued\n",
            "It's like a frozen oatmeal chocolate chunk cookie milkshake! SOOOOO GOOD!!!\n",
            "Will never buy another flavor of ice cream , by far the best I've ever had\n",
            "Love the cookies & brown sugar ice cream! Definitely one of my favorites ~\n",
            "No flavor can replace Oatmeal Cookie Chunk, but this is a solid option.\n",
            "Delicious! It just needed more oat cookie swirl and less fudge chunks.\n",
            "Felt like trying something new and now I don't want any other flavor!\n",
            "I had this ice cream yesterday and will be buying it again very soon!\n",
            "bought this flavor on a whim and LOVE it great paired with a brownie\n",
            "Best they have please do not get rid of this. Needs to be permanent.\n",
            "I just don't think it needs chocolate. Otherwise it's so delicious!\n",
            "Currently eating this for breakfast! I believe this is my new fav!\n",
            "The combination of flavors are great and the texture is awesome!\n",
            "This ice cream is amazing! I wish it wasn't so hard to find!\n",
            "Love this flavor. Like that it is new a different flavors\n",
            "This is the BEST flavor they make!!! Absolutely sinful!\n",
            "I'm super picky but this one is light and delicious !!\n",
            "Over at first swirl and please except my short review.\n",
            "B&J skimped on the cookie dough! Oatmeal nonexistent\n",
            "This is the best Ben and Jerry’s flavor of all time.\n",
            "Sooo Glad the Oatmeal Cookie Ice Cream has returned!\n",
            "Amazing texture: creamy and solid chocolate chunks.\n",
            "I’ve been getting this flavor everyday for a month!\n",
            "This is definitely on my favorites list! AMAZING!!!\n",
            ":):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):)\n",
            "My new favorite flavor. I love Oatmeal cookies!!!\n",
            "Love this!! This flavor is definitely my new go-to\n",
            "Has to be one of my new favorite flavors!!!!!!!!!!\n",
            "One of the best flavors! I hope it sticks around:)\n",
            "Now you have to be in a peanut butter mood to have this ice cream, but when you are, it's the best. I'm impressed. It would be easy to make the rookie mistake of going for the cream when you're only feeling somewhat ~nutty~ but this is a flavor that makes you commit. So before you purchase, ask yourself, am I feeling nuts enough for this today? If the answer is yes, then taking home a pint of this ice cream will probably be the best decision you make all day. This is not necessarily my favorite flavor, but it is a fantastic one.\n",
            "Love the peanut butter flavor but the peanut butter cups are too big. They should be more broken up. With them being so big it makes it overpowering.\n",
            "What can I say about this one? It’s a simple concoction: peanut butter ice cream loaded with little peanut butter cups, and it is SUBLIME! As per usual, the ice cream flavor and texture are perfect and the pb cups are also. It’s also very dense and heavy so you feel good n’ full after you polish off a full pint (if you manage it). This is one amazing pint that always makes me feel better. I could eat this every night!\n",
            "I love peanut butter ice cream an d an never find it. Peanut butter cups are also my favorite candy. This combination is the absolute best. I hope you consider changing your pint slice to the peanut butter ice cream instead of the vanilla.\n",
            "Addict since the first time i tasted. WAY TOO PERFECT!!!\n",
            "If you love peanut butter, this is the one for you!! Sometimes there's not enough peanut butter cups, but the peanut butter ice cream is good all on it's own.\n",
            "Really enjoyed this flavour of ice cream! though I have to say that the peanut butter cups were usually whole or half... I think quarters would prob be better as they would be distributed more evenly through out the pint and allow more ice cream to be eaten with them.\n",
            "Also, I love the fact that because it's peanut butter, I (personally) can't eat a whole pint in one go, so it makes pace it out and last longer (very important in exam period) :)\n",
            "This is as good as it gets. My absolute favorite B&J flavor, as well as probably my favorite flavor of icecream. It broke my heart when they stopped producing it in my country.\n",
            "I am addicted to this ice cream. The only negative thing I can come up with is when there are too many butter cup chunks are in the same pot. They are just too hard and too sweet to be eaten without a sufficient amount of that smooth and mild peanut ice cream.\n",
            "After trying the magnum peanut butter flavour last week, I had to try this and its just as good! Smmoth peanut butter gives texture to the ice cream (and you can still taste the cream!) and the chunky chocolate gives the contrast.\n",
            "woo what a flavor! super peanut butter sugar goodness in the cream. but the cups? huge. like really chunky cups... which is cool if you're into that kind of thing! but my boyfriend and i felt like we were just eating Reese's with frozen Milk. Also.. kind of wish it had a social justice kick to it.. i really loved the one ice cream with the pictures of the young people on it! so awesome,\n",
            "Really even if you are not a fan this ice cream will blow your mind !!!!!\n",
            "I have eaten this many many times... It is literally perfection.\n",
            "One of my all time favorite ice creams, which is saying a lot because I usually do not go for peanut butter ice creams! The perfect blend of chocolate and peanut butter. Unlike most peanut butter cup ice cream flavors, they do not skimp on the peanut butter cup pieces. There are generous hunks of peanut butter cup throughout the pint! If you like peanut butter cups and you like ice cream, then you should definitely give this one a try.\n",
            "The packaging of this product reflects that the peanut butter cups are chopped up and distributed evenly. The pint I got had huge PB cups, like they were only chopped in half once and they were all near the top. Now this wasnt a terrible thing but sadly as we got past the halfway point there was no more delicious chocolate PB cups for us to enjoy. Made the last of it disappointing.\n",
            "The picture on the pint shows chopped up peanut butter cups distributed throughout the ice cream, but the pints I've tried had full or halved pieces in the middle of the pint and no smaller pieces throughout. Not a good mix-in.\n",
            "I bought this expecting a lot of peanut butter cups like I received the last three times I bought the product, but was disappointed when there were barely any. The ice cream was still very tasty, but it was a slight let down.\n",
            "I continue to buy this flavor, it's amazing! The balance of peanut butter ice cream to large chunks of PB cup pieces makes this masterpiece true perfection! I am not a huge peanut butter fan, but from this first time I tried it, I knew I was hooked. This is the only ice cream I buy! Good job Ben &Jerry for making the best (in my opinion), flavor in the whole world! Two thumbs up and 5 stars!!!\n",
            "I bought this for the first time here in holland and oh god it's soo good!! I'm not even a peanut butter fan but this is delicious!\n",
            "I cannot stop eating this one! Cannot walk into the grocery store and not buy 5 pints or more at a time. I love it.\n",
            "I'm eating some now thinking why is there no peanut butter sauce? Or what about just having peanut butter ice cream by itself? Just some ideas to add to the best ice cream ever\n",
            "I am buying this ice cream for my cheat meals after heavy leg days, because I looove peanuts, I believe this ice icream is healthy, but it could contain less sugar :) Also our stock in Slovenia is so small, and we have like 6 different tastes, and they are almost 7 eur, which is expensive in comparison with American price.\n",
            "Getting married in 3 days. Cooked my Fiance lovely dinner followed by Strawberry 's dipped in Chocolate and this icecream. $13 for half litre. Purchased from Charlies in Bassendean . Very grainy/ gritty. Perhaps had been thawed & refrozen. Bugger, Sue loves those boutique icecreams & this one missed the mark\n",
            "This is definitely one of my favorite ice cream flavors! The peanut butter ice cream has the perfect sweetness to it, and the peanut butter flavor is not too overpowering. I personally enjoy the larger chunks of peanut butter cups mixed with the smaller chunks. It is overall very delicious!\n",
            "I’ve never been a huge fan of peanut butter, but Ben and Jerry, you did it again. When I took my first chunky scoop- Pure. Magic. Creamy, chunky, and chocolatey all rolled into one. I do recommend a chocolate swirl just so it’s balanced out. Otherwise, delicious.\n",
            "I get a pint of this about every other week, it's AMAZING. If you're a peanut butter lover, this is the one you've been looking for. Peanut butter ice cream with generous sized chunks of peanut butter cups. They taste super delicious too! The best.\n",
            "I lose all control around this ice cream. I have to be careful about having it in the house because sometimes I can't stop myself from eating the whole pint in one sitting. It is so balanced and perfectly sweet. Well done Ben and Jerry!\n",
            "I hadn't had Ben & Jerry's in years. My husband brought home several different pints last night and OH WOW the peanut buttery, creamy indulgence of Peanut butter cup! I'm not even a big ice cream fan but this flavor is my new weakness!\n",
            "I have GOT to know how to get my hands on JUST the pb cups. They’re so much better than Reese’s cups And those are my favorite guilty pleasure. I buy the icecream just so I can pick the cups out and eat just them! Ha\n",
            "One of my top favorite go-to flavors! Each pint I've purchased is jammed packed with peanut butter cups. The cups have a nice balance of chocolate and peanut butter, which gives it a nice chocolate crunch texture.\n",
            "This is the ice cream flavor that really sold me on Ben and Jerry’s. The ice cream is sweet and peanut buttery and then there’s just loads of chocolatey peanut butter cups. The ratio is just perfect.\n",
            "A bit artificial flavor. Very powdery. Tastes like a not very good processed powder milk with just a hint of peanut taste.\n",
            "Chocolate bits to big.\n",
            "However, not the worst ice cream I’ve had.\n",
            "I'm not one for peanut butter cups and certainly not in ice cream, so my review may suffer for it on that account, but that's the way it is.\n",
            "I had a whole pint with not one peanut butter cup. Plus it was so grainy. It was like it had thawed and been frozen again several times...\n",
            "This is by far my FAVORITE ice cream in the world. I usually have to purchase 2 at a time. I wish these came in gallon sizes!\n",
            "This is very good ice cream. Tasty, reliable. However, it would be GREAT with a peanut butter swirl added to it!\n",
            "The flavor is amazing but I'm only giving 4 stars due to the size of the peanut cups. Makes it difficult to eat\n",
            "Perfect creamy peanut butter flavored ice cream with PB cups spread throughout. Dangerous stuff.\n",
            "I bought this yesterday and it’s already gone I love so much\n",
            "makes me never want to eat another ice cream flavor ever\n",
            "Buy far the best brand of peanut butter cup icecream.\n",
            "This ice cream actually had me spend a whole Sunday afternoon going to 3 different Targets to purchase it! I finally found some at the 3rd Target but was fully prepared to go to a 4th if necessary. THAT is how good this ice cream is!! The chocolate is rich, the peanut butter is perfectly blended in but then you get COOKIES TOO?? It just makes your mouth happy! I was addicted from the first spoonful and buy it in 3's whenever I find it. I almost hate to tell people about it because then it's less for me!!! Don't ever stop making it or we will be picketing in front of your factory!! LOL\n",
            "NOTHING ELSE MATTERS. TARGET RUNS OUT. HELP! RUINED FOR ALL OTHER ICE CREAM\n",
            "This is a tough one for me. I’ve tried 3 pints of this and the flavor is great. The chocolate ice cream base is perfect. It’s rich and creamy. The flavor of peanut butter and cookie swirls is also really really good. My problem is with how hard the swirls are. In my 3 pints, they were so hard that I could barely crack them with my spoon and they come out in one really big mass which makes eating the ice cream a bit of a wrestling match. But it all tastes SO good! It’s really decedent and rich and extremely filling. I will continue to buy it, I just wish it was easier to eat.\n",
            "So this is the second pint of a peanut butter focused flavor (the first being peanut buttah core) where the swirls are rock hard and jammed in the middle of the pint! I don’t get it. I have had countless Ben and Jerry’s pints and most have been perfect but I have to admit this is really starting to bother me! It isn’t supposed to be this way. I don’t to stop exploring new flavors but I feel like maybe I should just stick to my tried-and-true favorites. I’m sorry to be a downer but I’m really not happy that 2 out of 2 peanut butter pints had inedible swirls and cores! I usually give gushing, glowing reviews on here and I’m not a hard to please jerk. I just want ice cream I can eat.\n",
            "PLEASE sell this product in other places aside from target. Half the time they are out. If you haven't tried it, you must. Love, love love.\n",
            "Im addicted!! Target shows this is an \"exclusive & limited\" flavor...PLEASE...dont get rid of this!!!\n",
            "I can only find this at Target. From the first bite I immediately consumed the whole pint. Totally worth it. I love peanut butter Swirls and ice cream and the nice cookie crunch was a pleasant surprise. This is the only ice cream I will eat from now on\n",
            "Yes. I can’t stop eating this even though I promised I was done with ice cream. It’s like the crumbly cookie from a Carvel Birthday Cake, and salty peanut butter. It’s become my favorite all time ice cream. Please sell it in all stores.\n",
            "This ice cream is amazing. Never ever get rid of it!!\n",
            "I was shopping at target about 3 weeks ago, and I'm a peanut butter junkie, seen thus out of the corner of my eye. that night tried it the peanut butter infused, with cookie crunch, and chocolate ice cream, holy moly... my only upset is they only had 2 and since then I have not been able to find at either Meijers, Wal-Mart's, and target has not received more so I'm dieing over here. If ur a peanut butter, chocolate with a cookie crunch person this is the best combo to date\n",
            "What a wonderful combination! I thought you couldn't beat the combination of chocolate and peanut butter, but you totally did when you added chocolate cookie swirls to the mix. Thank you! Please keep making this flavor, it is my favorite by far!\n",
            "This flavor is incredible! Please take this off the special edition list and make it a regular flavor. It is perfection! Perfect blend of chocolate and peanut butter are delicious, and the PB swirls are exactly what I’ve been looking for. No other company makes an ice cream flavor like this. I have been buying it every time I go to Target. In fact it has increased my overall ice cream sales significantly. Thank you!! Please keep this flavor in circulation.\n",
            "Every time I need a peanut butter fix, this is my first thought\n",
            "I got this randomly when I was at target one day and I'm in love! Hands down the best chocolate peanut butter ice cream ever. I do usually get it at target because it's cheaper there... but the grocery store next to my house does sell it!\n",
            "This is a MUST. I tried it for the first time about a month ago. I've been looking for it ever since. EUREKA!!! I found it again yesterday and bought two. I so love this flavor! THANK YOU for being so wonderful.\n",
            "SO good! I would make a special trip to Target just to get this. VERY glad that B&J resisted putting hard chunks in this flavor like they do in so many of their flavors. This is rich and chewy and perfect.\n",
            "I love all Ben and Jerry’s and this is my absolute favorite! I’ve been stocking up since it’s an exclusive. I would hate to see this flavor go, definitely should be added to the list of full time flavors!!\n",
            "And it’s not even close! Just wish it was everywhere instead of just at Target. Three times I have planned on making it last multiple evenings. All three times I finished the whole pint in one sitting.\n",
            "This might be the best flavor of ice cream ever!! Please consider selling it at non Target locations so everyone can get their hands on this! At the very least, don't stop selling it there!\n",
            "How can this flavor be called \"Peanut Butter World\" when 2 out of the 3 ingredients listed in the description of the ice cream are chocolate? And in the ice cream itself, it's 95% chocolate. Is this a joke? The title makes no sense. Where's the peanut butter in this peanut butter world? The description says \"Milk Chocolate Ice Cream with Peanut Buttery Swirls & Chocolate Cookie Swirls\". How did you come up with the title from those ingredients? I love Ben & Jerry's ice cream, but y'all put chocolate in almost every flavor, even when it doesn't belong and it's so unnecessary. I love peanut butter flavored everything and most peanut buttery treats aren't peanut buttery enough for me. I just don't like chocolate that much and because of that I was very disappointed with this flavor.\n",
            "This is the only flavor I buy anymore. It is the epitome of ice cream. I dare anyone to try it and say otherwise.\n",
            "This is my favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor. I go out of my way to Target to buy it and no other ice cream compares. Please make this one full time and expand it to Walmart or something!! It's the perfect combination of salty and sweet, peanut butter and chocolate. The cookie crunch is the icing on the... ice cream. Anyway, it's wonderful.\n",
            "I saw this flavor on the website and went to my local Target to get it. I was in love after my first bite. I love the combination of the peanut butter and rich chocolate ice cream. The cookie swirl is so good! Please don't stop making this flavor. It is one of your best in my opinion. This is my new favorite flavor!\n",
            "It's. So. Good. Definitely the best flavor to come out in a long time! But please make it available in places other than Target. It's inconvenient to get to and they never stock enough of this flavor. Give the people what they want! More Peanut Butter World!\n",
            "I'm always searching for ice cream with peanut butter and often disappointed by the sparse amounts of peanut butter. The peanut butter world ice cream has the perfect blend of peanut butter and chocolate. I hope this flavor remains available!\n",
            "I never have to think about it if someone asks me my favorite ice cream flavor - it's Peanut Butter World, hands down! I really wish I could find it in more stores than Target. It is the perfect ice cream flavor. Please never stop making it!\n",
            "Made a special trip to target just to try all the new flavors and so far this is my favorite! If you like peanut butter you will love this! I think I’m going to need to make another hour trip to target again to get more!\n",
            "This is the best ice cream ever. It’s the only flavor I eat. The peanut butter is the very best flavor and the cookie texture is the bomb. I wish it wasn’t exclusive and I could find it more places. Love love love this.\n",
            "Just found this flavor today and ate the whole pint already. I love Peanut Butter Fudge Core and this is soooo much creamier and the cookies add a nice texture. Please don’t take this one away!!!\n",
            "This flavour is amazing! It’s like my favourite parts of the Tonight Dough, in its own pint. Can you please bring this one to Canada? I promise we love PB in the great white north.\n",
            "This is, without question, the best ice cream flavor in the world....and I consider myself an expert. I only wish I could find it at other spots besides Target.\n",
            "PB World is my favorite ice cream flavor ever. It's hard to find on my town! If I can't find it, I go with my #2--Chocolate Fudge Brownie.\n",
            "Had never seen this one before but it changed my life. Been a B&J's fan for as long as I can remember and this is definitely my new #1!\n",
            "This is my favorite ice cream flavor ever, and I’m addicted to ice cream! Only wish it was sold in more stores than just Target!!\n",
            "This is my new favorite! I hope Ben & Jerry's always carries Peanut Butter World because it makes the world a better place :)\n",
            "This was an example of heaven on Earth. By far the best ice cream flavor yet to be invented. 14/10 recommend.\n",
            "please never take this flavor away its amazing im so inlove with it please keep it 10/10\n",
            "This is the best flavor Ben and Jerry's has come out with!\n",
            "I love peanut butter in general and have tried many peanut butter ice creams. From the moment I tried Peanut Butter World, I knew I had found a favorite. What makes it different (and freakin delicious) is the crunch of cookie in every bite. There was a period of time when Target was sold out and I was seriously going through withdrawals! If you love peanut butter, do yourself a favor and try this ice cream. You’re welcome.\n",
            "I've been buying this flavor for about three years now, and while I'm not a fan of ice cream typically, this is DIVINE. I buy it 4 canisters at a time at any Target I can find. Some may say it has too much peanut butter in it (or something similarly insane), but this is really the only ice cream on the planet that I enjoy. I only wish I could find it at more places.\n",
            "This is the #1 best chocolate-peanut butter ice cream you can buy. Ben & Jerry's other peanut butter ice creams are not as good due to the inclusion of mini peanut butter cups, which lack the peanut butter flavor you get from the swirls in this flavor. As far as I know you can only buy Peanut Butter World at Target, and I've made special trips just for this!\n",
            "Every time I think I have shaken off my love for this ice cream the combination of sweet chocolate and salty peanut butter drags me back in. The chocolate is sweet without being cloying, and the peanut butter offsets that perfectly. This is the ice cream I choose to splurge on (eat an entire container of) for my birthday.\n",
            "My favorite part about Ben & Jerry's is that they don't have corn Syrup in the ingredients. At least not with this flavor. I think their ice cream has remained the same and most wonderful and as corn syrup does horrible things to my skin, Ben & Jerry's gives me the ice cream i crave, without the breakouts.\n",
            "im a huge pb fan and this was done so well! Ribbons of peanut butter and then cookie crunchies add delicious texture to the creamy chocolate ice cream. Thanks B&J! Only downside is being exclusive to Target, my first trip there they were out. Managed to score a pint second time around.\n",
            "This is the best ice cream in the history of ice creams, ever. That is all. It is a party in your mouth. If you like peanut butter and chocolate, eat this. You will not regret it. Except possibly after you look down and realize you ate the entire pint in a euphoric daze.\n",
            "This is hands down my favorite flavor that B & J has ever made. Creamy chocolate, THICK peanut butter ripples, and chocolate cookie ribbon soooooo good. My only complaint is that you can only purchase it at Target. PLEASE make it available at other retailers!\n",
            "This is one of the best Ben and Jerry's I've ever had (peanut butter half baked is up there too)!!! I hope they have plans to expand it to other stores, not just a target exclusive. I bought 3 pints just in case. Delicious!!!!!!\n",
            "I saw on here that they came out with this new flavor and I had to try it. I go to find it and I got the LAST one! I am blessed. This stuff is delicious and my new favorite type of ice cream. Highly recommend. This slaps!\n",
            "This is hands down my FAVORITE flavor - and I have tried a lot! The combination of milk chocolate ice cream with the peanut butter swirls is amazing... then you add the chocolate cookie in there - to die for!!!\n",
            "I have loved this ice cream the minute I read about it and found it at Target. I haven't been able to find it for several months now, though. Please make it available other places!\n",
            "From the first bite I was in heaven! I LOVE the \"chew\" of the slightly salty peanut butter with the crunch of the cookie crumble. I seriously obsess about this ice cream.\n",
            "I love a good chocolate peanut butter combination and this is the best ice cream combo I've ever had. Please make this a standard flavor and sell it everywhere!!\n",
            "This is by far my favorite flavor and I wish they were sold places other than target. The ice cream is perfect and creamy, and the peanut butter is just right.\n",
            "It’s so good I couldn’t put the spoon down. I ate the whole pint . I couldn’t get enough of the flavorful goodness, bite after bite. Yummy in my\n",
            "Tummy!\n",
            "I tried this a few months ago and have been addicted ever since. This has that perfect combo of chocolate and peanut butter. Amazing. <3\n",
            "I can only purchase this at a Target store a few towns over, and when they have it in stock, I load up! By far the best flavor ever!!\n",
            "I am somewhat of a connesseuir of peanut butter and chocolate ice cream. This is hands down the best store bought I've ever had.\n",
            "If you love chocolate and peanut butter you will LOVE this ice cream!!! The chocolate cookie pieces take it to a next level.\n",
            "I have bought it twice in the last month and have ate it within a day! Best ice cream flavor i have ever had! Hands down!\n",
            "Parent Trap would be proud. Chocolate Cookie and peanut butter dream. My favorite ben and Jerry’s yet!\n",
            "This product is perfect! The peanut butter and the cookie swirls go so well with the milk chocolate.\n",
            "It’s just so good. While we try all the flavors, and have our favs, this is our default flavor.\n",
            "I love peanut butter and this ice cream is the best peanut butter ice cream I’ve ever tasted.\n",
            "I love chocolate ice cream with peanut butter and the cookie adds a great mix!\n",
            "Totally addictive- incredibly rich. Our new all time favorite\n",
            "Favorite ever. Do yourself a favor and get this flavor.\n",
            "This one is delicious and has great flavor and texture\n",
            "I thought it would be to rich, but it was perfect!!\n",
            "I feel like I'm literally addicted to Ben and Jerry's Phish Food! It seems as if I can't get enough of the super creamy chocolate ice cream with the heavenly swirls of Marshmallow and Carmel throughout it and the wonderful little bonuses of fudge fish that are so \"chocolatey\" that they quench my desires & cravings!! But then as I start to see my spoon scraping the bottom of the container I rush to my freezer just to make sure I've got 1 more pint of Phish Food in there for later!!! Phish Food has all the \"bells & whistles\" that will please any ice cream chocohlic!!! My final words: Ben and Jerry's Phish Food Ice Cream is DAMNDIDDLYICIOUS!!!!!!! (my made up word for very delicious)\n",
            "I cannot speak more highly of this flavour. I love that it has the perfect balance of both taste and texture: The sweet and soft marshmallow swirls, offset by the mildly bitter and crunchy fudge fish, and tied together with caramel. I usually eat a whole pint on my own, and would save each \"phish\" so I get one in each spoonful towards the end. I always wish there was more! Nevertheless, it's still my favourite flavour, and I hope it doesn't get forgotten or overshadowed by the newer products. This brand is so expensive in my country, but I still save up and buy it as often as I can. It's THAT good.\n",
            "Sometimes I think, man, Ben and Jerry's is kinda expensive... then I see this flavor on the shelf and I'm ready to go in debt. Let me just say, you guys need to put marshmallows in your ice cream more often (in recipes that make sense of course lol). The texture for this ice cream is wonderful and I really think it's because of the marshmallows. I have never bought Phish Food and been unsatisfied. And the thing is: I don't even care for chocolate ice cream. It's the flavor I always come back to, even when I swear to try something different.\n",
            "I have never been a fan of any chocolate-based ice cream, but phish food (& b&j fudge brownie) is the exception. It is the perfect combination of ingredients. Best dessert I've even had.\n",
            "I tried this for the first time last week and holy cow!! This pregnant girl is never getting another dessert\n",
            "This is our favorite flavor in our household!!! I'm obsessed w the ooey gooey marshmallows with a scoop of a phish and a Carmel swirl mmmm.... if only I can buy a bag of the chocolate fish they put in there!!' That would be even more amazing! Is there anyway to just get the little chocolate fish?? ;) my fiancé would be ecstatic! Haha he's always digging for the fish in my pint\n",
            "One day I was in an extra curricular activity and a friend of mine was placing Phish Food in the freezer. It was a hot day and I am basically okay with any kind of ice cream so I asked if I could have it and she said, 'Sure'. I went and grabbed a plastic spoon from the cabinet, opened the pint, and stuck the spoon in scooping up some ice cream. Before that moment I thought all ice cream was more or less similar. Boy, was I wrong! After tasting that first spoon full, I knew it was the most amazing ice cream I ever tasted!\n",
            "Oh my god! My new favorite! I cannot say enough about how good this one is. The fudgy chocolate ice cream, the fudge chunks and the copious amounts of marshmallow and caramel! I’m making myself hungry for it so I need to stop typing this. IT. IS. SO. GOOD!\n",
            "Ben and Jerry's ice cream has always been a source of Unique flavors, but none as uniquely perfect as Phish Food. I've been eating Phish Food ice cream since I can remember. No flavor has yet to match it and I've tried a lot of ice cream.\n",
            "You can fight me on this but you’re wrong. Phish Food is the best flavor ever made. And not just by Ben and Jerry’s, but any company in the history of the freezer case. Nothing comes close to this ridiculous combination of chocolate, fudge, marshmallow and caramel. I am so thankful for this ice cream!\n",
            "This ice cream is so amazing with the marshmallow swirls and fudge fish! Please make a Non-Dairy/Vegan Phish food so I can enjoy this creation but as a vegan!\n",
            "Arguably the best Ben and Jerry's flavor, it's possible to eat an entire pint alone and not notice until the spoon scrapes the bottom. It's that good. The little fish are adorable, AND they taste like the best chocolate ever. I wish I could buy them by the bag, their perfectly melt in your mouth amazing. Add the caramel and marshmellow and it's super sweet, but doesn't pass the line of Too Sweet. Much love to Ben & Jerry for their amazing ice cream!\n",
            "I always check for \"new\" flavors or \"limited batch\" selections, however Phish Food is my go-to! My absolute favorite flavor....the gooey caramel and marshmallow swirls and the fudge fish are magical!\n",
            "I absolutely love the caramel, marshmallow and chocolate chunks! I've eaten so much of this ice cream and I dont regret it! This makes me so happy!\n",
            "I’m addicted to this Ice cream it is sooo good the chocolate and marshmallow is not too sweet and the fudge “phish” is my favorite part.\n",
            "Phish food is the most amazing tasting ice cream I have ever had. Even better than homemade ice cream from the ice cream parlour. The chocolate ice cream base is rich and creamy, with just the perfect amount of marshmallow and caramel swirls. The chocolate fish are amazing, they a a slightly darker flavor than the chocolate ice cream making for a tasty chocolaty combination that is not too sweet, but sweet enough to satisfy my insasasionable craving for chocolate.\n",
            "This is my ALL TIME most FAVORITEST ICECREAM!!!!!!\n",
            "I am completely addicted to this ice cream. This was the first Ben and Jerry's ice cream I ever tried and I have tried others but none compare to this masterpiece. I don't see it in the case everytime I go to the grocery store so whenever I happen to pass by it and notice it's there it's a MUST BUY! The combination of the chocolatey ice cream and thick marshmallow swirls with the fudge fish is enough to send anyone over the edge. Amazing!\n",
            "My husband was trying to do something nice for me and buy me ice cream while I was busy trying to eat \"healthy food.\" He came home with Phish Food and I said: \"naw, I don't think I'll like it. You can eat it.\" And then he opened it and shoved it in my hands with a spoon. I tried two bites I was sold. Now I have dreams about this ice cream and won't buy or eat anything else. I'm hooked for life!\n",
            "Very sweet, but great combination of flavors and textures.\n",
            "My go-to flavor when ever I'm sick, sad, grumpy, or just in need of a pick me up! The marshmallow swirls come up and are like sweet little Angel kissed. The caramel swirls are sticky gooey globs of yummmmm and the chocolate chunks - shaped like fish - can make anyone giggle.\n",
            "This has been my favorite ice cream for years. They did away with those little cylindrical problematic marshmallows and replaced it with dreamy fluff. The caramel is always physics defyingly gooey, and the soft crunchy fudge fish are always a delightful surprise.\n",
            "I love all ben and Jerry’s but somehow always end up going back to this one!! The caramel and gooey marshmallow mix together way better than I would have thought and the crunch of the frozen chocolate breaks it up for another added flavor.\n",
            "the flavour was so good that i had to buy it again! strongly recommended.\n",
            "I was introduced to Phish Food about 4 years ago. I absolutely love it! It is the only flavor of B&J's Ice Cream I have tried and I have no desire to try others because I am pretty sure this is the best. Won't you agree with me?\n",
            "This is my favourite ice cream in the WORLD! I love the chocolate phish, I wish you could buy a bag of them separately so I can keep adding extra to the ice cream. PLEASE bring out bags of phish chocolates!! X\n",
            "Probably the most amazing mix of flavors in 1 pint. This mix is every possible thing you could want in ice cream. Believe me when I say if you haven't tried it, it should be 1st on your bucket list.\n",
            "This ice cream is my everything. Once ate a gallon In a month. It is so amazing and you will not regret buying a pint (or 50)!!!!! It is so incredibly good, and eating it is indescribable euphoria.\n",
            "Seriously. . . I was NEVER an ice cream fan. Didn't like it. Never craved it. That all changed when I was introduced to Phish Food! *Game Changer*!! Love this ice cream. Love, Love, Love.\n",
            "YEARS ago Phish Food came as a novelty ice cream on a stick. It was somehow even better this way! I loved it because when I had a craving for it, no waiting, unwrap and devour!!!\n",
            "I’ve been getting this flavor since I was a little girl. I love the chocolate fish and the marshmallow cream. So yummy it will always be a special flavor to me\n",
            "I always thought chocolate ice cream was a pale imitation of the real thing until I tasted Phish Food. This stuff should be considered an opioid, its so good.\n",
            "I’ve been getting phish food ever since I was little, and every time I get it I get flashbacks of when I was a child. Phish food is by far my favorite flavor.\n",
            "This is my favorite ice cream, and I honestly believe that the world will end of this is ever discontinued. Plus, those little fudgey fish are cute as heck.\n",
            "Huge favorite of both me and my three sons! (they are triplets.) Delicious chocolate ice cream with some caramel. The chocolate fish are also delicious!\n",
            "This has been my favorite flavor for years. I have never had a quality control issue with a pint, and it always satisfies my chocolate cravings.\n",
            "This has been my go to chocolate getaway combination. Solid chocolate fish and chocolate and caramel oh my! #2 on my top #10 list for sure!\n",
            "I've been wanting to try this one for a while and I am SO glad I finally have. This one is loaded with all the good stuff, so super good.\n",
            "Awesome combination of flavors. I'm satisfied with the generous amount of marshmallow and the perfect ratio of chocolate ice cream!\n",
            "I get this all the time since a kid. The chocolate flavor is so pure and delicious, I crave it! Totally worth the try. Yum yum yum\n",
            "No really she left me for this ice cream. I told her she had to choose between Phish Food and me and I guess its that good.\n",
            "This is one of my absolute favorite flavors! It tastes delicious and I would eat it every night if I could!\n",
            "Best ice cream ever ! There is absolutely nothing that will make this better than it is !!\n",
            "I love this icecream so much. So in love with this delicious ice cream! Nom nom nom\n",
            "forever the only ben and jerrys flavor i have tried because I'm addicted to it\n",
            "very good tasty and yummy it was amazing!!! i cannot imagine something better\n",
            "If aliens came to earth and we had to feed them phish food would be the movw\n",
            "I have bought this flavor recently and I have to say it’s become my favorite\n",
            "YASSS!! I love this flavor!!! I love ice cream! I LOVE BEN AND JERRY'S!!!\n",
            "The best mix I've ever had, nothing beats Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream..\n",
            "Its really good and addictive, i am in love with this ice cream\n",
            "Has to be my favorite, everything your dreams are made of\n",
            "Whenever I eat this, I can’t get over how delicious it is\n",
            "Officially my favorite ice cream in the WORLD. Wow!!! ♥️\n",
            "When I was younger, this was my absolute favorite!\n",
            "My favorite flavor ever!!! The combination is perfect!\n",
            "OK I know this is gonna sound crazy but when I first started eating phish food there was no Carmel in it. I have been looking for years to find phish food that does not have Carmel. Everyone I ask insist that it always had caramel in it, which is not true. Phish food was the 1st Ben and Jerry's ice cream I ever ate I haven't eaten it since they started putting Carmel in it does anyone know how I can get phish food without Carmel Please.\n",
            "I love everything about it. The caramel and marshmallows make the ice cream so smooth and delicious, but my favorite part is the cute little fish-shaped chocolate pieces! Not only are they cute, but the chocolate itself is amazing. Thanks Ben and Jerry's for creating such an awesome flavor!\n",
            "This flavor was the first ever flavor I bought of B&J. It is very, very good but very,very rich. I typically only buy this if I am craving chocolate (which I never do, go figure). It's overall, very good but it's so rich. I really wish there was a vanilla option, or maybe a little more Marshmallow swirl to mellow out the chocolate.\n",
            "I love Phish food ice cream, it’s my favorite ice cream of all, and I’ve had a lot in my short lifetime. I did recently get a tub that only had about 4 fudge fish in it. :(( the fudge fish are my favorite part of this ice cream, if y’all made a chocolate bar out of that stuff I would buy it allllll the time. Upset that I didn’t get many in this tub, so hopefully there’ll be more in the next.\n",
            "Cherry Garcia was my absolute favorite of all ice creams until I tasted Phish Food. With apologies, I have had to move C.G back to second place. Phish Food is creamy, chocolatey, caramel heaven (not to mention those nifty little chocolate fish) and it's all I can do to stop myself from eating the entire pint at one sitting. Thank you for your Divine Creation.\n",
            "This flavor is perfect! I first tried this a couple months ago and I was so happy I did. I was a little skeptical because I don’t usually like marshmallow but this taste great. The chocolate and caramel with marshmallow complements each other very well, and the chocolate fish chunks are so cute and tatsty. I eat the whole pint at once. I highly recommed!!!\n",
            "I didn't know what to expect when I bought this pint since there were so many ingredients, but the chocolate ice cream is not too bitter, and the caramel & mallow swirl are maddeningly delicious. I catch myself \"phishing\" the container just for the swirls. The fudge fish aren't redundant like you might think they'd be. Excellent flavor.\n",
            "Of all the Ben & Jerry's flavors, this is the one that when I'm looking over a grocery store selection and I'm uncertain what to have that I'll most often choose. It's quite sweet between the chocolate ice cream and the caramel, but the addition of the little fish and the creamy marshmallow allow for a very pleasant textural element.\n",
            "Gooey marshmallow with caramel in a chocolate ice cream and fudge fish, I’m glad the ice cream isn’t too intensely chocolate cause the other flavors come through with each bite. I’ve been getting this pint for over a decade and I’ve loved it since I first tried it, above all other favorites like Americone Dream or Cherry Garcia.\n",
            "In 2005 I travelled to London and I tasted Ben and Jerry's ice-cream for the first time. I stumbled across the Phish food variety and I fell in love. I was obsessed!\n",
            "I live in South Africa and you don't get Ben and Jerry's here (why????!!!), but it is something I still think about 14 years later! I loved it THAT much!\n",
            "Hands down my favorite flavor of ice cream! The mixture of the caramel, marshmallow, chocolate, and fudge fish is delightful, and it’s helped me through many a last ditch attempt at completing NaNoWriMo! I usually keep a few pints of it on hand to enjoy or share with friends!\n",
            "Try it- you won’t regret it!\n",
            "ive been getting this flavor of ben & jerrys ice cream since i was younger, and ive always enjoyed it. I can’t get if very often tho since where i live its $5-6 or more, but when i do im always glad i did. its my favorite flavor of ice cream and i would always recommend it to a friend :’)\n",
            "Tried this chocolatey, gooey, luscious ice cream the other day and OMG this has to be the best ever it’s so scrummy I can’t stop talking about it ( is that sad oh well ) will be filling the freezer for sure, please don’t ever stop making this it’s definitely a make you feel good wonder.\n",
            "I try very much to avoid the frozen food section at the market because if I do go there I will undoubtably purchase at least 2 pints of B&Js Phish Food. And if I want my jeans to fit I can not eat a pint of the greatest ice cream every night-even if I want to (maybe when I’m old and gray?)\n",
            "I hadn't had this in a while and bought a pint, I forgot just how good it is and I was only going to eat a quarter of it but I just couldn't put down the spoon! I ate the whole thing with absolutely no regrets! Thank you for making such wonderful products!\n",
            "The chocolate fishes tasted a bit like dog food, and i would have liked more Mallomars and caramel swirls\n",
            "This is the one, and the only one. It’s absolutely perfect, and everything I want in a scoop of ice cream. This is more than ice cream, it’s happiness and satisfaction. I have not found anything else that comes close to Phish Food.....you will be addicted.\n",
            "The chocolate ice cream was bland. It should have had a rich or fudgy flavor. The phish should have been more like the chunky monkey fudge chunks.\n",
            "I tried it for the first time, and when I tell you I fell in love, I'm hardly exaggerating. The consistency of the marshmallow is to die for, gooey and perfectly swirled through creamy chocolate goodness dotted with rich fudge fish- I need a pint.\n",
            "I bought this last night and I’m going back for more ! It’s so chocolatey, love the marshmallow swirls and fudge fishes there are so many in just one pint ❤️❤️ Definitely recommend this flavor if you haven’t tried it !!\n",
            "I was disappointed when I opened the cup and it was nothing like the packaging! I only tried it because it was new to me! It was pretty bad! I will go back to Dairy Queen!\n",
            "This is painfully sweet. Not much ice\n",
            "cream to enjoy either. Just HUGE globs of marshmallow and caramel. Tastes like straight sugar, and this is coming from someone who really likes dessert food.\n",
            "I absolutely loved this flavor. I felt like a big kid eating it. I will be buying more of this kind. The phish food is my new favorite flavor!!!\n",
            "This was one of my first flavours ever ( along with Strawberry cheesecake and Cookie dough). When I ate it it was the best moment in my life.\n",
            "My grandpa always ate this ice cream which led to my obsession with this flavor. Have eaten too many pints in one sitting to count...\n",
            "This is my die-hard-go-to-save-the-Day flavor the only thing I craved when I was pregnant, and I needs a full 5 stars ⭐️\n",
            "i thought'd i hate this flavor bc I don't like carmel or marshmallow that much, but this was a greattttt combo ugh\n",
            "9 months pregnant and I LOOOVE the phish food ice cream but the little chocolate fish give me such bad heartburn\n",
            "Best.ice cream.ever. Phish Food is a family favorite, but we also want to try many others.\n",
            "Its so yum. The different textures make it fun to eat. Its srumdillilyumpshous\n",
            "Phish food is perfect. My favorite and the best ice cream,ever!\n",
            "its good..... very very very very very very very very very good\n",
            "I love this Ice cream so much! It’s so good! I love chocolate!\n",
            "This is my absolute favorite ice cream, no matter what!\n",
            "This is my absolute favorite ice cream of all time!!!\n",
            "Phish Food is the best ice-cream in the world. Ever.\n",
            "Been eating this flavor for over 18 years the best\n",
            "I have had great, mediocre, and yucky ice cream/gelato all around the states and several different countries, and this is by far my very, very all-time favourite as the quality creamy ice cream has a cool subtle pistachio flavour and it is loaded with tons of toasted perfect nuts! What could be better than that? Sadly, I now live in Montreal, and have checked every ice cream selling market/deppaneur/etc. and cannot find this flavour anywhere! I need my fix! This is torture! (....and I don’t understand how we have such a huge French and Italian population here, why this is not one of the few flavours sold here!). :(\n",
            "This is my all-time favorite store-bought ice cream/flavor! Having been to Italy several times, I've had my share of amazing pistachio gelato. B&J's does it even better as you have the smooth, creamy lightly pistachio-flavored ice cream and lots of toasted pistachios for that great crunch within the creamy......perfection! Sadly, I've never been to a B&J's that offers this flavor, and it is pretty difficult to find in grocery stores and drug stores. So....when you do.....nab them all! :D You're welcome! (.....everyone always thanks me for turning them onto this flavor!)\n",
            "I have high expectations for Ben and Jerry's as they make fantastically wild flavors so when I saw they had a pistachio available I picked it up immediately. Before I even got home from the store I felt assured that I had found my new favorite ice cream (love pistachios), something to rival the pistachio gelato I get from my local coffee shop. Unfortunately, once I broke that bad boy open I was dismayed that what should've been a culinary treat was in fact plain, non-flavorful ice cream with hunks of rather hard pistachios in it. I was very disappointed with the experience and hope to never run across a similarly disappointing flavor again.\n",
            "This is our family’s favorite I’ve cream EVER! It has the perfect lightly nutty flavouring and a delicious, satisfying crunch of toasted pistachios throughout! Every bite is as good as the first! Sadly, I have not found this anywhere in my new home of Montreal, Quebec as the stores always only of the same few flavours (I’m guessing as branding for both French and English up here is costly). However, it surprises me that this is not one of the few options uphere as we have a huge European population (that, of course, loves pistachios). I would think it would be a huge hit! Sadly, B&J’s can’t ship time either? Sincerely, Heartbroken in Canada (a.k..a. Diana ;) )\n",
            "I went to one of my local grocery stores and picked up a pint of Pistachio Pistachio. I was looking forward to it all day. But when I finally tried it, it was not the same ice cream I was used to. The pistachios were soft and chewy and the ice cream did not taste like pistachio ice cream. I went to the same store again to buy another pint 2 days later and I was rewarded with the same bland tasting ice cream with soft pistachios. Plus once the ice cream melted a little, it was a little too frothy like there was extra milk or something in this particular batch. So very disappointed with Ben & Jerry's. I love this flavor, but not sure I want to risk a 3rd time.\n",
            "OK guys, I put on 30 pounds because of this stuff. It was worth it on one hand, because it's so amazingly delicious, but now I'm huge. Oh well. I'll lose some weight as long as this is waiting for me as an occasional treat.\n",
            "I bought My first Ben & Jerry ice cream thinking it would compete Haagen daz but i left with disapppintmemt. The ice cream had wierd taste of bitter almonds. Rest it is plain vanilla ice cream with some pistachio in it. Not upto the mark. The bitter taste was horrible\n",
            "I've consumed about 10 pints of this over the past 5 years. When it's good, meaning all the nuts are healthy, it's very, very good. It's pretty good when one or two nuts are a bit 'off'. But tonight I chewed into the most rancid, putrid pistachio of my entire life. Nearly hurled. Will not purchase again.\n",
            "B&J's Pistachio Pistachio is my all-time favorite ice cream - ever!!! The creamy smooth flavored ice cream and the crunchy salty nuts always give me exactly what my taste buds are craving. I remember the first time I ever tried this - I thought I died and went to heaven! <3 True Perfection <3\n",
            "This is the ONLY ice cream I buy and I have tried all the pastachio flavors of different brands. I will drive the extra couple miles just to get this stuff. I don't see how anyone could rate this one star.\n",
            "I have been eating Pistachio-Pistachio for several years and never grow tired of it. My favorite and before that is was New York Super Chunk. It takes a great deal to pull me away from good chocolate\n",
            "Anything less than 5 Stars don’t appreciate pistachios.. the guy who compliains that the nuts are too hard... Obviously is not a nut lover. This is a must if you enjoy crunch and nuts\n",
            "Here's the irony: \"The name alone shows how much we love pistachios. But don't just take our word for it - let the flavor speak for itself!\" The most forward flavor is almond extract, not pistacchio. Too bad, because there's not much better than a good pistacchio gelato. This is nowhere near that.\n",
            "This ice cream falls into the category of private joy for me. The superb flavor and variety of texture between the silky ice cream and chewy pistachios elevate me to another plane. My ultimate indulgence is to sip a glass of scotch along with a bowl (I try to keep it small!) of this wonderful confection. An adult treat!\n",
            "Horrible! Judging by the taste they have never had a proper pistachio dessert . You're better off spending extra money on another brand of pistachio. Or just getting a different flavor. This is my first time trying ben and Jerry's and I apparently picked the worst flavor of theirs imaginable. If I were to name this flavor it would be Pathetic pistachio. I'd give a constructive review but clearly they have been okay with the atrocity for this long and I dont believe it would help. 1 star for the fact that its icecream\n",
            "I guess everyone can make a lemon, but I haven't encountered one yet in the Pistachio Pistachio flavor. Especially like the salted pistachio mixed with the vanilla. The pistachios were good and fresh in all the pints I've had. Always look for it on the shelf now. Keep up the good work!\n",
            "I bought this yesterday from whole foods and all day thought, that a company like Ben and Jerry's would make the finest pistachio ice cream ever.\n",
            "This ice cream is tasteless and seems to have been made for the sake of making it marketable. the ice cream does not even taste of vanilla ice cream. It tastes like \"paper ice cream\" if ever someone were to make paper a taste.\n",
            "Such a waste of time and money. !\n",
            "I’m mean, here I am about to dig into another pint for the first time, and of course it’s excellent, just like the majority of the other ones. The ice cream itself is delicious; creamy and pistachioey and the pistachios are perfect. Killer pint! Thanks again guys!\n",
            "I appreciate the use of real pistachios in the ice cream because you don't see that too often. But because the pistachios are whole aaand there's so many in there, it's just a little too much. Maybe if they were smaller pieces and a tad bit less frequent. The ice cream flavor is nice though. Not too strong and artificial tasting like some pistachio ice creams are.\n",
            "My favorite!! I would never give less than five stars for Ben and Jerry's, however I think the last batch of this amazing ice cream was light on the pistachio... Usually full of them this one only had maybe ten total!! Still the best around.\n",
            "I didn’t have really high expectations when I bought this today but after tasting it just now I am headed back to the store to buy all of the containers. I’m pretty sure that if everyone ate some of this then there would be peace on earth!\n",
            "I’m a picky eater. Especially when it comes to nuts. Often you’ll buy a batch of pistachios, and a handful will be sour or off. When I buy Pistachio Pistachio, I never get a nut that is off. I’ve purchased this flavor COUNTLESS times. It is my favorite Ice Cream. I have never had a Pistachio that is less than amazing in these magical pints. I swear by this flavor. Do yourself a favor and enjoy this heavenly treat!\n",
            "The pistachio chunk is real, but the ice cream itself does not have any pistachio flavor. Put together it is a blank ice cream with pistachio chunks. I can buy a pint of regular vanilla flavored ice cream and eat with some pistachio on the side instead of this.\n",
            "Everyone in my house has their own ice cream and this is my all time fav. I love that i dont have to share lmao. Plus my 5 year old knows what to get me when she and daddy go to the store. # MyGuiltyPleasure\n",
            "I always stick to the same kind of ice cream but recently I decided to try something new and now I'm addicted. I buy a pint of Pistachio Pistachio at least twice a week if not more and I don't care :)\n",
            "This is my favorite flavor ever! Ever since I tried this flavor, I rarely pick another. It has a great sweet flavor to balace it out with the roasted pistachios. It's indulgent without being too rich.\n",
            "I usually buy pistachio gelato at the local ice cream store but I was in Publix at the time. This pistachio is by far the BEST I have ever had! You will not be disappointed!\n",
            "I always use to buy Karmel Sutra. But I thought I try this one. Its great!!!\n",
            "I was excited to try this flavor since it was gluten free (one of the few B&J options I can have) and Ben & Jerry's is my favorite ice cream-with quality ingredients and great flavors. But, was disappointed-felt like the pistachio flavor was weak and the base almost icy in texture.\n",
            "This flavor should be named “Almond Extract Ice Cream with Pistachios”. I was disappointed by the flavor profile. There is a generous quantity of pistachio nuts throughout the pint, but their flavor is overwhelmed by the almond extract, which by the way, has a bitter and lingering finish. Good consistency and mouth feel.\n",
            "Used to be heavenly. When I could find it, it was the best of the best. Six on a five star scale. It was pistachio through and through. Generous portion of pistachios nuts embedded in a delicious body of pistachio flavored ice cream. Then somebody in the last year went and spoiled the recipe with coconut oil. Now it's pistachios in coconut ice cream. Who messed with perfection?\n",
            "This is my favorite pistachio ice cream. The ice cream tastes simply like real pistachio with the roasted pistachios being the perfect added texture. I have purchased many pistachio ice creams from other brands and when Ben and Jerry’s came out with this one I have never looked back. Other favorites for me are Netflixed and Chilled, Cherry Garcia, and the discontinued Creme Brûlée.\n",
            "I honestly dont know what I was expecting with this being my first taste of any pistachio ice cream, but all I could taste was almond extract. Even the smell of the icec ream smells like almonds?\n",
            "I love pistachios so I thought I would love this ice cream. Unfortunately the pistachios overwhelm the ice cream so it’s too savory for me. I thought way to many nuts, maybe if they were halved or crushed, the flavor would go into the cream. Very disappointed and won’t get again. The amount of nuts (I know, you’re supposed to get at least one nut per spoonful, but way to much.\n",
            "The icecream itself had a very strong bitter almond flavor taste, the texture of the cream also was very gritty. We expected the product was expired but it wasn't.\n",
            "I'm ok with almond but it disappointed my wife who is a pistachio lover but an almond hater. This tasted more like almond ice cream with pistachio nuts. Compared to pistachio ice creams we have had, this falls far short for any nutty, strong pistachio lingering fragrance and taste we were expecting from a name like \"pistachio pistachio\"\n",
            "This ice cream by far beats any other brands. The ice cream has a perfect creamy taste, with whole pistachios. It's just hard to find because the stores by my house are always sold out of this flavor. But any time I do buy ice cream I will drive the distance just to get this.\n",
            "I bought pistachio ice cream because I like pistachio flavor. But this vanilla's flavor is like Dr. Pepper. So, weird. I expected it taste really pistachio.\n",
            "All this is, i just vanilla ice cream with pistachio nuts just thrown into it. i paid for pistachio ice cream but all i got was a peace of garbage.\n",
            "Basically vanilla ice cream with large chunks of pistachios. The nuts are not broken up. I understand if you don't want to use artificial coloring, but the pistachios should be broken up into smaller pieces! That would make it tastier.\n",
            "This is my favorite. So glad that the ice cream is also pistachio flavor, not just vanilla ice cream with pistachio nuts added. The nuts are whole and big, not just pieces and slightly salty. Worth the price. Love it !\n",
            "I want the pistachios removed and this ice cream labeled \"Amaretti for More!\"\n",
            "Then I'd eat it and never stop. As it is, I spit out the pistachios and enjoy this almond extract flavored ice cream immensely.\n",
            "I like the flavors going on in here. The ice cream has a taste reminiscent of marzipan and pistachio mixed and there is a generous amount of crunchy pistachios. This was quite tasty and I'll buy it again.\n",
            "I love this ice cream. It's the fifth food group for me. It's my snack, my treat, my comfort food! Yes, the nuts are fresh and yummy. Actually, it is the only ice cream I eat. Need I say more?\n",
            "I love the fact that they had actual pistachios in the ice cream, but the \"pistachio\" ice cream tastes like powder. It doesn't taste like an actual pistachio ice cream. Frankly, it was disgusting.\n",
            "Fan freakin tastic! So good. My favorite! I loved pistachio pudding as a kid, but this is just out of this world. Chock full of plump pistachios and held together by creamy goodness. Love it!\n",
            "I have high expectations for B&J icecream. However, this flavor disappoints. The icecream tastes more like almond/marzipan and the pistachio flavor is lost among these overpowering flavors.\n",
            "I would like to think of myself as an ice cream enthusiast. I literally eat ice cream every day. Ben & Jerry's never let me down. This flavor, Pistachio Pistachio, is an easy 5-star rating.\n",
            "This is an amazing Ice cream! I love the ratio of nuts to ice cream. However, a pint is usually a single serving for me. PP is my favorite B&J flavor! And I have tried many!\n",
            "I love the flavor of the ice cream and the fact that the pistachios are whole. This ice cream is so good I don’t want to settle for any of my old favorites now.\n",
            "If you're looking for pistachio flavored ice cream, this isn't it... it's good don't get me wrong, but it just doesn't strike me as \"pistachio tasting\".\n",
            "This has always been my all time favorite flavor. Its a shame I can only get it in the US and not anywhere else in the world. This is the best!\n",
            "Love this ice cream...light but really tasty and great pistachio flavor. Unfortunately my local grocery chain stopped carrying this flavor :(\n",
            "I absoulty love pistachios and when I seen this I knew I'd have to try it. OMG! I think I'm in love with an Ice Cream nothing but the truth!!\n",
            "Delicious every time I’ve had it. I could go for some hard pistachios and more of them but I’m not picky its delicious how it is y’all\n",
            "I CAN FIND IT ANY WHERE I'M IN NEW ORLEANS AND ITS MY FAVORITE ICE CREAM THE ICE CREAM IS SO SMOOTH THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF FLAVORS.\n",
            "Oh my goodness Pistachio Pistachio is so delicious! My favorite flavor with a nice supply of crunchy pistachios in every bite.\n",
            "Since the first time I tried this flavor it was my favorite. Sometimes its hard to find because not all stores stock that kind.\n",
            "Love at first taste! Pistachio Pistachio got me\n",
            "through pregnancy..........and still helping me muddle through motherhood :)\n",
            "The ice cream and nuts complement each other perfectly. I thought Chunky Monkey was the best flavor, this ties with it.\n",
            "This is my favorite flavor of Ben & Jerry's! The ice cream tastes wonderful. Once you start eating it you can't stop.\n",
            "This is my go to flavor. EVERYTIME. I'm obsessed. I moved to Brazil a couple months ago, and I definitely miss it.\n",
            "I’m a huge pistachio lover....and I love this ice cream!! I even use it to make my pistachio pound cake\n",
            "I absolutely love this ice cream. Simple but amazing. Perfect light flavor loaded with pistachio nuts.\n",
            "Butter pecan, you are dead to me now.\n",
            "Ben and Jerry's Pistachio Pistachio is my new favorite!\n",
            "Omg I love pistachios and this is one of my favorite ice creams lol I love it ! its delicious\n",
            "This is my favorite ice cream hands down. I was they had it in the gallion\n",
            "Cant even take a spoonful of it. Tastes just like maraschino cherry. -5/10\n",
            "Pistachio Pistachio is wonderful..Don't buy any other flavor for myself.\n",
            "Definitely worth the price but I wish I can buy this is a larger size.\n",
            "Can’t get enough of this flavor! Sooo many pistachios packed inside!\n",
            "yum- what else can I say- good flavor and pistachios are authentic\n",
            "This is my favorite ice cream. bar none. All time favorite.\n",
            "If you love pistachio pudding you will love this even more!\n",
            "It's more like vanilla ice cream with pistachio nuts inside\n",
            "In spite all the busy new flavors - this is still the best!\n",
            "I love it but its hard to find. Please keep it coming.\n",
            "First flavor I look for when I get ben and jerrys.\n",
            "I love the toasted pistachio's in it! It is yummy!\n",
            "Best flavor out out there! FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
            "I absolutely love the blueberry cheesecake but can't find it anymore. I stumbled across Pumpkin Cheesecake at Albertsons in Wildomar, CA and this has to be the best Ben & Jerrys yet! My husband said he's ready to spend a ton of money to stock up. It's identical to actual pumpkin cheesecake! During the 110 degree temps it's sooooo good! I'll be raving about this! Thank you for bringing back another amazing cheesecake flavor!\n",
            "This has been my favorite ice cream since 2008 when I first tasted this flavor. Since then, finding it was the worst experience ever! It is made in limited batches, and was NEVER in the same store every year, so you became an explorer to find it each year! Was it in Walmart, Wegman's, Shop Rite, CVS, or where every September? I knew this was the time the first batch was delivered! FINALLY, this year they have a specific page on their website for Pumpkin Cheesecake. All you have to do is put in your zip code, and it will tell you where is the nearest establishment to purchase this in incredibly, tasty, scrumptiously delicious frozen treat!!! Good luck, and be careful of brain freeze! You're gonna love it!!!\n",
            "This is my favorite ice cream flavor ever. I usually buy dozens of pints to stock up every fall!\n",
            "I bought this last weekend, I am not sure how but it was still available at a local Walmart. I have been wanting to try this flavor, and figured it was long gone, but to my surprise I was able to find it, so I figured it was a sign from above. Overall, the pumpkin flavor tastes familiar... But over seasoned... It is a bit boring, and honestly this ice cream could be amazing. The graham cracker swirl is more of a.... occasional chunk. Honestly, the graham cracker swirl was to die for!! It was the highlight of this ice cream... If they could just add more swirl, I would be much more impressed overall. The swirl definitely breaks up the boredum of the ice cream, it is a bit repetitive. I think a huge glob of swirl would be amazing.\n",
            "I just bought this flavor from target.. i went there to get chunky monkey but they were all out. Ive tried every other flavor and this was the LAST pint of this flavor. I like pumkin pie but its not my favorite... i love all of B&J’s cheesecake flavors so i thought i mayyyyy like this one.......\n",
            "I Baught this in Brattleboro Vermont while looking at their delicious ice cream! & oh my gosh! It's a complete favorite! Can't get enough!!\n",
            "I couldn't believe it! Who would have thought something so simple in a pint would be heaven in your mouth? Omg amazing!!\n",
            "This is the BEST ICE CREAM EVER!!! Taste like real pumpkin pie! So amazing, I have never had anything this good before!\n",
            "This taste great. I wait every year for the pumpkin ice cream to come out. So glad it comes out a little bit early. Pumpkin ice creams are my favorite and this one is delicious.\n",
            "Hands down the best pumpkin ice cream I’ve ever tasted! My dad introduced me to pumpkin ice cream at Baskin Robins when I was a kid and although he passed away, every time I eat this B&J flavor, I think of him. Your pumpkin ice cream doesn’t have a weird after taste I’ve experienced in other pumpkin ice creams. (Which I only bought out of desperation when I couldn’t find B&J.) The graham cracker swirl is heavenly and like an extra blessing of happiness! I look forward to autumn every year so I can eat your Pumpkin ice cream and think of my dad.\n",
            "So smooth and and delicious every chance I had I bought 4 of them!\n",
            "Simply the best! I wish this was available year round\n",
            "Great flavor. Tastes like pumpkin cheesecake blended into ice cream. The swirl is gritty and has great texture.\n",
            "I had this icecream years ago, it was immediately my favorite, and was upset when they stopped carrying it in my local stores the next following years. I hadn’t seen this icecream in about 3 to 4 years in my local stores. I checked so hard for it every year when fall hit. I even checked stores when I was out of town, ect. I finally found it this year at the store it’s been missing from, and I’m so happy. It is just as amazing as I remember. Wish it wasn’t a limited batch! Hope to see it next year!\n",
            "Last time I had it bought the last 2 pints @ Walmart in Puerto Rico a couple of years ago. It was the last time since never seen it again anywhere.\n",
            "Came across this gem in Walmart and fell in love. The one thing that would make it perfect is a little more of the graham cracker crust.\n",
            "Makes Pumpkin spice season worth it! I always try to buy tons but it never lasts :/\n",
            "Just picked this up a couple of days ago. Figured since it was my year to try out some of these much beloved pumpkin spice and pumpkin flavored items, that come out. I would give this ice cream a try. I'll be the first to admit pumpkin flavored anything is not a go to favorite flavor for me during the Fall or otherwise. So I had low expectations going in. But once I tried out a little bit that was inside the lid....have to say I fell in love with this super light pumpkin flavor. Even enjoyed the light graham cracker swirl. Just the further down I went into the pint, not sure if it was do to the larger the swirl became or the mix of the graham cracker with the spice in the pumpkin in the base. But the taste of the swirl just got real nasty throughout the middle section of the pint. But it got better again towards the end though.\n",
            "I thought I would never find an ice cream to replace One Love that they killed off a few years ago (I’ve seen it back randomly for short periods, but it never lasts), but finally I have. Naturally the one ice cream I love is limited batch. Anyway, it’s amazing. It tastes exactly like pumpkin cheesecake and the graham swirl is awesome. I could eat this all year. I would eat this all year if it was available.\n",
            "This is my all time favorite flavor and I am already having trouble finding it in stores! Like said in the description, it's not pumpkin spice flavored so I do not feel like it would go out of taste at other points in the year. I am in love with the graham cracker crunch in it, and the ice cream is so incredibly creamy (probably from the real pumpkin). Please please please make it a full time flavor!\n",
            "This is truly a flavor everyone should try. Unfortunately this can only be found in a few big box stores or super marts. The B&J locator shows what stores have it in stock. But when i get there, i find a messy freezer with flavors all over the place. When i ask the staff for help , they are clueless and defiantly not on target. I hope to find this ice cream some day but for now i will keep looking\n",
            "I look forward to this amazing flavor every fall. It’s like spooning into a fresh, creamy pumpkin cheesecake, the graham cracker swirls make it absolutely perfect! My only issue is trying to get my hands on a few pints, they sell out super fast, so if you see them? Grab ‘em! If you’re like me & love pumpkin EVERYTHING, you’ll absolutely love this ice cream. It’s worth stocking up on :)\n",
            "This is my absolute favorite!! I hunt it every year. Well I bought my first one of the season today... it was gross and so sad. Have hunted the last couple years and couldn’t find it, so I was beyond excited when I found it today. But to open it and it have zero flavor because i think it was not stored properly..it was all mushy and had crystals and wouldn’t harden.. ughh\n",
            "This is actually my favorite ice cream but the last few years I noticed it's hardly any Graham cracker. You guys use to put a thick layer of crackers in the ice cream m that's what make it so good. What happened. Is it to save money. I almost don't wanna buy without the\n",
            "thick Graham cracker. I feel the same about strawberry cheesecake also\n",
            "Perfect for those that enjoy pumpkin flavors. Amazing for the fall, but I could enjoy this year round. The ice cream was creamy, good balance of sweetness, with a good ratio of ice cream to graham cracker swirl. I wish there was more of a cheesecake flavor, maybe add some cheesecake bites. I would buy again.\n",
            "I'm usually not one for the trend of all pumpkin-flavored or pumpkin spice-flavored things, but I saw the Pumpkin Cheesecake B&J at the store and I had to try it. Oh my goodness, I'm so glad I did! The flavor is delicious and the graham really brings it to a 5/5. I've already purchased 3 pints!\n",
            "I love this ice cream I give it 4 stars because it is expensive for that little container instead of 5 stars :-*\n",
            "I love everything pumpkin,\n",
            "So when I saw this AND saw it was ben and jerrys I was in! However when I tried it it was kinda underwhelming in pumpkin taste. The cheesecake was there but the pumpkin taste was little to none. Maybe it was just a bad pint pick but I'm still super sad about it.\n",
            "I'm SO sad this is only out during fall. This is so good, it should be out year round. It doesn't have much of a cheesecake flavor but it has the light and buttery accents. The graham cracker swirl makes this pint what it is, AMAZING! Make this a regular flavor!!!\n",
            "I bought this a few months ago, and I think it might have been old, because the ice cream was incredibly frosted and I couldn't distinguish any sort of graham cracker swirl at all. Definitely disappointed.\n",
            "I tried this for the first time in October.. haven’t stopped eating it since. I literally CRAVE this ice cream!! I really, really hope they make this a permanent flavor instead of just the limited batch\n",
            "I love pumpkin flavored things, and have trouble finding ones that I can eat because I am allergic to Ginger. I did get to try this ice cream before realizing it had ginger in it, and it is amazing.\n",
            "I've been buying this ice cream for a few years now. I check the supermarket freezers even in the off season. It's the best ice cream I've ever had. My props to Ben and Jerry for this creation!\n",
            "The Ben & Jerry’s Pumpkin Cheesecake is the absolute best Ice Cream from a store I have EVER had!!!! I wish this was made year round but I will be stocking up on it so I have it for months!!!!\n",
            "I tried this last night and it is delicious. It captures the flavors of autumn perfectly. I wish this would be a permanent flavor offering though. It is that good.\n",
            "every time I find this ice Cream in the stores i end up buy atleast 10 pints of it bc it is soo hard to find. wish is would be avail. all year round\n",
            "This is my Thanksgiving dessert (and dinner) when I end up having to work the holiday. Has all the right flavors and a nice blend of pumpkin spice.\n",
            "I bought this 3 weeks ago and already had theee of them. It is the perfect amount of sweet with a bit of salty from the graham crackers. I LOVE IT\n",
            "Tastes exactly the way it should. Real, fresh pumpkin flavor and a very nice graham swirl. I have 6 more of these in my freezer and I’m glad I do.\n",
            "My favorite Ben and Jerry’s flavor EVER. Everyone I have told about it is hooked too. Please please please just make this a permanent flavor!\n",
            "I am addicted to this, you beacons of yummy evil. Not too sweet, the graham cracker swirl is perfect. Please keep this one on permanently.\n",
            "I love it!!! I hope they make it a permanent addition to their lineup!!! Oh, and bring back Willie Nelson's peach cobbler!!!\n",
            "My favorite, the best!!! Every fall I look for this flavor, I wish they would make it all year long instead of seasonally.\n",
            "Pls, pls produce more. I think I got ONE last year, can't find any yet this year - supply is always sold out. :(\n",
            "I usually don't like anything g cheesecake flavored but this was amazing! Should make it a permanent flavor.\n",
            "Super tasty! As a fan of 1. ice cream 2. pumpkin 3. Graham Cracker pie crusts this is heaven in a pint!\n",
            "I love this flavor. But it is really hard to find in my area. Wish it was stocked in more supermarkets.\n",
            "The flavors are fantastic, so complementary! Wish this wasn’t a limited flavor it’s that good!\n",
            "If your looking for something amazing that makes you think of fall then this is the perfect.\n",
            "The flavor is creamy and good and it has soft pie crust swirled into the recipe, love it !!\n",
            "#PumpkinSpiceEverything I love this!!! I wish they can have this flavor all year round!!!\n",
            "Extremely good has a light pumpkin taste. It doesnt over power your taste buds\n",
            "This pumpkin cheesecake is so good I have to buy more the best ice cream\n",
            "Loved a homemade version but couldn’t get more saw this. Delicious\n",
            "Wait for the fall to buy and stock up this at a local store.\n",
            "My favorite by far. Wish I could get it year round. Love it.\n",
            "I love pumpkin. I love cheesecake. Fantastically addicting\n",
            "Absolute perfection!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
            "i give this icecream a 3 star. because 5 js licking spoon to its core. 4 is not enough chunks but yummy creamy icecream flavor. 3 is.... well this. def not enough cookie or strawberry. and not enough blueberry icecream flavor. needs LOTS more. tasted like vanilla icream with very rare moments of tastebud excitement when the tiny chunks of shortbread were finally dug up. Did i eat it in 2 days? yes. Did i enjoy eating it? yes. Did i look forward to wating it in the future? no i forgot about it which means it wasnt great. Will i buy again? if they advertise it after this review \" with an overload of added chunks\".... ps.. looks nothing like the picture smh :(\n",
            "I read the description of this flavor and thought this might be an instant classic. Raspberry and blueberry ice cream? And strawberries too? Ooh! But I have to say this flavor was a disappointment. All I could taste was vanilla and the shortbread. Now blueberry isn't the strongest flavor in the world, but you would think it could be amped up at least a little. And maybe it's just me but I could not taste the raspberry at all. And the pint I purchased had only a few bites of strawberry. The flavor was not bad, but it was nothing like i was expecting. Instead of \"wow!\", all I experienced was \"meh\". I'll stick with my old favorites and keep hoping for a resurrection of \"That's My Jam\".\n",
            "Okay as I said in another review. I bought this with 2 other flavors(Sammie flavor and the sweet like sugar flavor), and I was the most leery of this flavor. As I tend to enjoy fresh blue and raspberries as opposed to having them in ice creams. As they just don't taste right or good to me. But in this flavor. I'm not sure if it was the fact that there was the vanilla swirl and short bread cookies, that balanced things out or what. But this turned out to be a lot better than I expected. Again, I know others may not like it, because it's not one of B&J's chunck induced, fudge freckled classics. But it's definitely a step in the right direction in balancing out more natural even flavors, with deep, rich, and sometimes too salty flavors as well. So definitely keep mixing it up for sure.\n",
            "I love this flavor !!! The bursting flavor blueberry and raspberry and little fireworks of strawberries and shortbread pieces is a delicious way to make any day better, but not only that but every bite is so satisfying and gets better bite after bite!!! Definitely my new favorite!\n",
            "The vanilla itself isn't even that great tasting and vanilla is all this ice cream flavour really is. The blueberry and raspberry portion of ice cream taste just like the vanilla, the strawberry pieces are few and far between, and the short bread chunks were about the same. The ice cream could be a great flavour if they reworked it and added some more flavour to the blue ice cream portion and adding a little more chunks of fruit and cookies.\n",
            "I was so excited to find this flavor (raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, shortcake! ! ) and so disappointed when I tasted it. First off, grayish purple ice cream is just NOT RIGHT! Second, flavor. It doesn't taste like anything but overly sweet vanilla. I found 3 threads of red that, if you squinted, might have been strawberry. The globs of shortcake were a disgusting greenish color and again, too sweet. No fruit flavors. Would I buy this again?? No. Will I finish the pint? No. Will I buy B&J's again? Meh.\n",
            "If you tripled the amount of shortbread, at least, I could give this a 3 star rating. But it also hardly had any strawberry; maybe 5 tiny little pieces(but that's a stretch) Raspberry? Where? That was non existent. And the blueberry could also be kicked up a notch... Also, just take out the vanilla all together. Other than the name, there is no need for it.\n",
            "I bought this on vacation expecting nothing but then I ate it and the texture reminded me of Play-Doh in all its glory (without the smell, which is still awesome in its non-edible glory) and it was SO GOOD. This is the first time in over 10 years I sat down and almost ate the entire pint and it had nothing to do with any kind of appetite stimulating...um...recreational activities. YUM is the three letter word that a Jeopardy question would ask and this would be the answer. More of this all day, at all times.\n",
            "I have bought 3 of these! So delicious. Sometimes I find the flavors overwhelming so this is a great one for people like me who enjoy ice cream but not crazy amounts of different flavor.\n",
            "If you ate this with your eyes closed, you would swear it’s vanilla with an occasional chunk of something that you couldn’t really place. Good vanilla, but...vanilla.\n",
            "Wasn’t gross because it’s ice cream. :-p. However I was very disappointed. Tasted very plain like vanilla. Not a lot of chunks either. Not fruity at all.\n",
            "I enjoyed it but could be better. more shortbread chunks, more strawberries, and stronger blueberrie taste\n",
            "Usually love Ben and Jerry’s so I Thought this would be great but ended up being kind of tasteless.\n",
            "the best ice cream ive ever had! i bought it once and couldn't find it again\n",
            "Almost like eating a berry pie! I love this. I have been waiting around for this type of flavor/texture since another company launched a similar flavor YEARS AGO but with graham cracker crust! They only had it through summer and i haven't seen it since! I really enjoyed this because it wasn't chocolate, caramel, candy, etc. This is my FAVORITE! Please do not discontinue this flavor!\n",
            "I only had white and blue ice cream that lacked flavor. No strawberries or shortbread pieces. This definitely is not an ice cream I would purchase again.\n",
            "Usually love Ben and Jerry’s but this was the most bland ice cream I’ve ever eaten from them\n",
            "I picked this up with the new Ice cream Sammie flavor and I have to admit this flavor was underwhelming for me. I’d like to see more of the raspberry and cookies pieces inside. Unlike like the Ice cream Sammie flavor this one is flavorful enough for me. I wanted more but really loved the idea of the flavors all together.\n",
            "Tried this tonight and found it tasteless and boring. There were some little reddish dots of something, with some pale violet swirls that were tasteless. There were some gritty cake-like bits in the colored swirl. B&J make such great ice cream...this is not one of them.\n",
            "I wish I had purchased some other flavor.\n",
            "I bought this flavor because I loved the Maine Blueberry ice cream that Ban and Jerry’s used to make. All I tasted was vanilla with what seemed to be something like pound cake globs. I even tried tasting the flavors separately but no berry flavor to be found. Also, MIA were the strawberries. So sad\n",
            "Was super excited about this one, but all i taste is vanilla and even though my pint looks filled with blueberry, theres no flavor, no berries and no shortbread! I feel like this was a waste to buy I should have bought my go-to flavor of phish food instead.\n",
            "The pint had around 6 strawberry pieces in the entire container. The shortbread was also lacking in quantity and in texture and flavor. The shortbread was soft nasty no flavor blobs, thank goodness only a few pieces made it into the pint.\n",
            "One of my favorites that I can’t seem to find :(\n",
            "The taste is for someone who doesn’t want the overwhelming globs of chocolate or caramel type tastes & instead like a light airy tasting ice cream. Tastes really fresh.\n",
            "There were very few and very tiny bits of shortbread and raspberries. Doesn’t look like the picture on the container. Tastes good, but disappointing considering other bj ice creams have loads of stuff in them.\n",
            "Sounds amazing, tastes bland. Not a single strawberry or ANYTHING red was found in my pint. Also missing from this pint was flavor! It had an odd overly sweet vanilla flavor and that was pretty much it!\n",
            "Just bought the red white and blueberry and was very disappointed, no raspberry at all. Mostly vanilla and very little shortbread. Won't buy again. Usually Ben and jerrys is amazing. Not this one.\n",
            "I love this ice cream! Totally addicted to the little blueberry shortbread pieces- this is a berry lovers dream! An alternative for ya folks who aren’t chocolate and caramel people.\n",
            "This is my favorite ever. Sadly it's an exclusive to one store. Now it's not even for delivery. This was getting me through Covid19 and now I have to find something new.\n",
            "I bought this today from a Walmart in Evansville IN! It was a fruity ice cream which I’m not always a fan of, but for some reason this did it for me! Highly recommend!\n",
            "Not very flavorful & the shortbread adds a gritty/mushy texture. I couldn’t taste raspberry, the blueberry was dull & the strawberry just didn’t work in the mix.\n",
            "I love this flavor! It is subtley berry flavored and I really like it! Love the strawberries and the shortbread pieces. One of my favorites!\n",
            "Just tried new flavor and really enjoyed. It was not overly sweet and the shortbread gave it a nice texture.\n",
            "We love this one! Its not sweet but, yet has so much flavor. Try it out you won't be sorry!\n",
            "Favorite ice cream ever. It’s delicious. Come out with a bigger size to enjoy for days\n",
            "Best flavor you have! Love it. Reminds me of Royal Britannia which I miss a lot.\n",
            "Delicious scrumptious tasty awesome lovely delightful love it❣️Thank you ❤️\n",
            "This is my favorite flavor but it’s hard to find at the grocery stores!\n",
            "Really yummy! But could have more strawberry pieces.\n",
            "Awesome combination, the blueberry and shortbread.\n",
            "This has long been my favorite Ben and Jerry's flavor - the chocolate ice cream in it is deep, dark and delicious, the graham crumb swirl adds just the right bit of texture, the \"toasted marshmallow\" is more complex than the straight-up marshmallow in Phish Food, and the chunks of chocolate are of the highest quality. Sadly it is hard to find in my area - I look for it in any store I go into and when I find it, buy as many cartons as can fit in my freezer! I tried the new Limited Edition \"Gimme S'More\" flavor and found it very disappointing. I certainly hope Ben and Jerry's isn't planning to replace the classic S'mores with this new flavor - I'd be heartbroken!\n",
            "I could eat ice cream everyday and am a bit of a chocoholic, so naturally this is my go to flavor for Ben and Jerry's. Although there are several other chocolate based flavors, its hard to compare and I went through serious withdraw when I couldn't buy it when living in the U.K. While this used to be easy to find in my local grocery stores, I've recently seen it replaced with the new Gimme S'more flavor on the shelves. I am hoping that it isn't going to be discontinued, as the new flavor is completely different. Never one to write reviews, but I feel so passionately that I wanted it to be stated that some of us out there love this one, despite the lower rating.\n",
            "This is my all-time FAVORITE ice cream flavor--period. Ben & Jerry's is terrific, but they have far outdone themselves with S'mores. Nothing else compares. It's been my favorite ice cream since I was a kid, and nothing has ever come close to replacing it. Unfortunately, it also happens to be the MOST DIFFICULT flavor to find. There are no retailers near me that still carry it--it seems to have been phased out, and I hope not in favor of \"Gimme S'more,\" which can't hold a candle to the original S'mores. The rich chocolate flavor, punctuated by fudgy chocolate chunks; paired with velvety toasted marshmallow and delightfully crunchy, textured graham cracker swirls--nothing compares!\n",
            "This is by far my favorite ice cream ever. I don't know what it is, but I am totally addicted to it and will pretty much eat the entire pint in one sitting, even though I don't like eating ice cream that much. I've driven long distances to buy this and was on the website right now just to find out where I can buy this since I just moved to a new state. I was shocked to see that this has some negative reviews and I felt that I should pay the ice cream back by writing this review. But anyway, best ice cream ever.\n",
            "The main problem with this flavor is that it has a very poor balance between the three components of a s'more: graham cracker, chocolate and marshmallow. In its current iteration, the chocolate ice cream base completely overpowers everything else to the point where you're left with what tastes like plain chocolate ice cream.\n",
            "I would suggest completely reinventing this flavor with a graham cracker flavored ice cream base, with chocolate chunks and a much more generous amount of marshmallow swirl.\n",
            "I think this flavor has the potential to be a fantastic, stand-out flavor, but as it stands I will not be buying it again.\n",
            "I love Ben and Jerry’s. There are a few flavors in particular that I call Melters. This is because I melt into euphoria at the first bite. There are a few that are so good that with the first spoonful I am in heaven. This S’mores ice cream is perfect in my opinion. The chocolate base (B&J does chocolate better than anyone) is dense, rich, sweet, and decedent. The graham and toasted marshmallow play perfectly together and create layers that come apart while spooning, and with the fudge chunks, and this effect makes the pint ridiculously delicious! Just FYI, the other melters are Chocolate Fudge Brownie, Phish Food, Chocolate Therapy, Half Baked, Gimme Smore, Tonight Dough, Peanut Butter World and Chubby Hubby.\n",
            "S'mores is by far my favorite B&J's flavor. I was upset to see the other reviews saying they were so disappointed! Maybe it was something in a recent batch or whatever, but anytime I get it, it's always perfect! The graham cracker swirls are the best part. So delicious!\n",
            "I'm in love with S'mores. In fact, I fell in love with my husband over a pint of S'mores. As teenagers, we shared spoonfuls of the richest chocolate, creamiest marshmallows and bites of graham cracker perfection. 15 years later, we still go \"gaga\" when we spot it in a store. My only wish is that we could find it more often--it's certainly hard to come by in the tristate area.\n",
            "Ever since I was a baby I have loved this flavor. When we did a vote in our family about who was the messiest ice cream eater I was voted number one but especially with this flavor. I find this flavor my very favorite and I think that no other flavor is even close in the good range. You're in heaven when you eat it. It has the perfect amount of every flavor. I love it! Definitely a must in your freezer!\n",
            "This flavor was a disappointment. The chocolate ice cream with chocolate chunks over powers the marshmallow swirl and the graham cracker has yet to be tasted. This flavor needs a revision. In the summer when you bite into a s'more you are instantly hit with the graham cracker taste that is followed by the marshmallow and then warm chocolate. This ice cream should be the same. Graham cracker flavored ice cream with an ample amount of marshmallow swirl followed by chocolate chunks and graham cracker bits would do this flavor justice. As it is now, I will never buy again, I won't even finish this pint!\n",
            "There aren’t enough stores that carry this flavor! There aren’t nearly enough chocolate based b&j flavors but this one is perfect! The roasted marshmallow is so good & the graham is delicious. The only thing I might recommend would be to add more graham ... and to get more stores to carry it!\n",
            "This is my wife's all time favorite flavor of B&J (going back to when it was called Marsha Marsha Marshmallow), but we cannot find it anywhere near us even though the Flavor Finder says 2 different chains in our area carry it. I've been to all of those stores in ~10 mile radius and they don't even have a slot for it on the shelf. B&J's online store doesn't even carry it. I would be willing to pay a hefty premium to have it delivered at this point. I did see it recently at a Safeway in California when I was there on business, but was not in a position to try and haul it home with me on a plane. WE WANT THE S'MORES!\n",
            "My absolute favorite flavor of Ben & Jerry's! The chocolate ice cream as always is delicious. S'mores ice cream should always have a chocolate base. I love the texture of the chunks of chocolate and graham crackers. I'm glad they chose to go with a whipped marshmallow rather than fluffy marshmallow chunks. This flavor really can't be beat!\n",
            "It's not like I can find it anywhere anymore but, it's still my favorite. Hopefully B&J will get with the program and have it more widely available in NYC again!\n",
            "Cannot even taste the graham cracker or marshmallow. I taste more marshmallow in the Phish Food. Chocolate should not be the base of this ice cream it completely overpowers anything else that could be there. I'd recommend a graham cracker ice cream with ample swirls of marshmallow and fudge as a remake of this flavor\n",
            "Phish Food used to be my favorite, until I first had S'mores. Now I can't get enough of it. For some reason it only appears to be sold in Publix in my area, so I have to make the extra trek to Publix just to get me some S'mores. The problem is they sell out of it frequently so I have to check back often. Very well balanced and frankly addictive. Please expand the retail distribution so all the s'mores fans in my area don't have to fight for the limited inventory at Publix. THANKS!\n",
            "I look for the S'mores every time I hit the grocer. Now to find the ever elusive S'mores Ice Cream bar!\n",
            "This particular flavor has to be one of my favorites I absolutely love the marshmallow swirl and the graham cracker pieces.The chocolate chunks were good too though I wish the pieces were a little bit smaller, still, won't stop me from getting this ice cream.\n",
            "This is my addiction! I love it's more a semi sweet chocolate with the marshmallow and graham cracker... I have no idea what I will do if they ever stop making this ice cream. I call dibs on the recipe if you ever discontinue!\n",
            "I die of sadness every time I’m in the mood for B&J, but the store doesn’t carry this flavor...it has ALL THE THINGS...delish chocolate ice cream, graham cracker crack bits, and sweet, sweet toasted marshmallow swirls. One of the few foods in life that is worth the calories...when I see people give this flavor a low score I literally want to fist fight them.\n",
            "So this was my favorite ice cream ever!!! all the flavors match so well and the combination of the chocolate ice cream with the graham cracker is great. If I could ask for anything would be to have a little more graham cracker in it, but is still absolutely delicious. However I'm deeply sad to see that this flavor is no longer available... just so disappointing and now I'm struggling to find another ice cream to substitute my favorite ever S'mores! :(\n",
            "head and shoulders the best of the bunch. why so hard to find?\n",
            "I tried this a week ago then just now put it up against Phish Food. Here's the deal, imagine your a the S'mores flavored ice cream for a moment...then you looks at yourself and essentially you realize you've been created as a competition to Rocky Road ice creams and your own sibling Phish Food. Someone else offered an amazing idea of making this a graham cracker ice cream GAME CHANGER!, lets take it onestep further,..Making it a CORE then my freinds you've done it, A S'mores in a pint, the outside consists of a Graham Cracker Ice Cream and a Marshmallow & Fudge core. idk food for thought.\n",
            "When I was living in NYC, I found this flavor one time in my local bodega. Ever since then, it's been my favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor. I recently moved back to Michigan and cannot find it anywhere! The graham cracker swirls balance out the decadent chocolate flavors and the toasted marshmallow adds this gooey element that is perfectly complex and sweet. Luckily, when I visit my boyfriend who is stationed in North Dakota, his store carries it and I'm able to get my fix. I hope this flavor never gets discontinued!\n",
            "I just melt when I dig into certain B&J flavors and this is one of them. Everything about S’mores is great, I just wish the marshmallow and graham swirls were thicker. This is a great pint and I will definitely be buying it again.\n",
            "My husband and I drive all the way across town to buy this ice cream at least twice a week! It is the BEST! I love that is is very chocolatey with a hint of marshmallow and graham cracker. It's perfection!\n",
            "I was excited to see a few brands of ice cream offering s'mores flavor at my supermarket! S'mores is one of my favorites! I thought the flavor might be difficult to capture in an ice cream and decided my best bet was to go for Ben and Jerry's. It seems I made the wrong choice, as their ice cream tasted like chocolate chocolate chip. There were a few graham cracker swirls, but I couldn't detect any marshmallows. I don't know if the marshmallows were supposed to be flavored within the graham cracker swirl, but the taste never came together as anything but chocolate. The ice cream was a super delicious chocolate chocolate chip ice cream, but if you are expecting an ice cream resembling s'mores, I'd try another brand.\n",
            "If you are like me and enjoy S'mores, you will not be disappointed with this pint. I have read some of the bad reviews and I think people have come across some imbalanced pints, but that it no way should take away from what this flavor is at its best. I have had imbalanced pints in every flavor and chalk it up to nuances in the manufacturing process. This one may be slightly more prone to imbalances, but the flavor is so good that I am more than willing to put up with a few \"misses\" from time to time.\n",
            "PLEASE, this is my favorite flavor and if it went away I don't know what I would do, the graham cracker chunks are heaven and everything about this spells happiness.\n",
            "I love this ice cream. I wish they sold it in a bigger size. I would literally buy gallons of this stuff. Best flavor ever!\n",
            "I love chocolate ice creams and this is my favorite of them all..\n",
            "I accidentally bought the \"new\" s'mores flavor thinking it was this one. This one has much better flavor. It tastes like Smores because it has marshmallow and Graham cracker and chocolate. The new one tastes like vanilla ice cream with Oreo cookie pieces. Nothing Smores about it.\n",
            "This is one of my favorite flavors. So chocolaty! I love the marshmallow and graham cracker flavor too!\n",
            "Love the toasted flavor in the marshmallow and overall is one of my favorite flavors!\n",
            "First time trying s'mores ice cream and I love it!\n",
            "I was craving s'mores on a hot day, which naturally led me to the perfect idea: s'mores ice cream! I was so excited to try this flavor that I bought two tubs of it at the store, only to be sorely disappointed. This doesn't even taste like s'mores, it's basically just chocolate ice cream. The chocolate ice cream base overpowers all the other flavors... such a disappointment.\n",
            "I'm a long time Ben and jerries fan, and I've never been let down by any of the flavors, until this one. In the entire pint I only got one bite of marshmallow, which is not what I expected from and ice cream named smores. It would have been an excellent flavor if it had more marshmallow and graham crackers in it.\n",
            "My favorite, but suddenly I can't find it! I am overcome with grief at this development. Other chocolate/marshmallow-y ice creams suffice, but it's the slightly salty graham-y flavor that really makes S'mores fabulous. Phish Food is much too sweet, and all those dang fish are in the way. Please tell me you're not retiring this flavor. If you must retire it, I demand Glampfire Trail Mix be put in regular rotation, bc if I can't have a graham cracker swirl, then a pretzel swirl will have to do.\n",
            "I don't understand all the bad reviews for this flavor. It is my all time favorite, and I think it's perfect. The marshmallow and graham swirls give it a nice soft texture, with the chocolate chips giving it just a bit of crunch. It is a little heavy on the chocolate flavor, but then again, so are real s'mores. Graham and marshmallow are subtle to begin with and come through great here. I haven't tried the newer flavor that has graham ice cream, but don't know how it could improve on this!\n",
            "Oh my goodness this is my favorite ice cream ever. The chocolate ice cream base tastes dark, which is so rare and hard to find. I absolutely love it and can't get enough. Thank you! I hope you never change the recipe.\n",
            "This ice cream combines everything I love about smores. The chocolate ice cream is a perfect choice for the base--creamy, rich, delicious. Ben and Jerry's has managed to create an amazing gooey marshmallow with a real toasted marshmallow flavor. I go crazy over that marshmallow swirl. I'm also crazy for the graham cracker bits--they add some amazing texture to the ice cream that I love, and have great flavor. Then, to top it all off, the crunchy chocolate bits. This is a great ice cream if you like texture in your ice cream, and I do. This is fun to eat, and totally delicious. This is an ice cream you have to stop after the first bite (and the 20th!) to say \"Wow, that's good.\"\n",
            "Side note--I tried \"Gimmie Smores\" and found it frankly dull. It tasted like generic cookies and cream ice cream. It wasn't rich and decadent and exciting like this. S'mores is a far superior ice cream. Also, the Campfire ice cream hits some similar notes but still isn't as good. I don't like nuts, and I appreciate having some amazing ice creams that don't rely on those for interest. This is the real winner.\n",
            "This is the best combination of flavors! We love this ice cream so much and it is impossible to find. Really hoping it is not replaced with the new Gimme S’mores flavor which is not great.\n",
            "I took one spoonful of this and fell in love. I could not stop eating until I reached the bottom. Hope this never goes away. Did not have any marshmallows, but I was too in love to care.\n",
            "I LOVE Ben and Jerrys ice cream. I LOVE anything s'mores flavored so I thought this would be my new favorite B&J flavor but unfortunately I was disappointed. It really did not taste like s'mores at all and tasted pretty much like plain chocolate ice cream. I was really rooting for this one because I love s'mores but this did nothing for me :( it would be the perfect ice cream if it tasted like actual s'mores!\n",
            "What makes me sad is ben and jerrys has the ability to make this a great ice cream, but they didn't. It tastes like chocolate chocolate chip ice cream. I actually thought I got a dud pint because i couldnt taste any graham. If they did a separate thick graham cracker swirl a la their pumpkin cheesecake ice cream and a thicker toasted marshmallow swirl it could be what it claims to be. Won't buy this flavor again.\n",
            "This is the best flavor in my opinion but it not stocked very well in the KY area. Makes it very hard to find!!! Please fix guy!\n",
            "Ben and Jerry's Smores is my favorite flavor of not just b&j but ALL ice cream in general. It's AMAZING! Smores ice cream should always have chocolate as a base and the toasted marshmallow creme tastes JUST like real toasted marshmallow.\n",
            "I found this flavor a few months ago and haven't had another flavor of ice cream since. I am super sad I can't seem to find this one anymore since it seems to have been replaced with the \"more s'mores\" flavor (which is infinitely worse)\n",
            "This is my FAVORITE flavor Ben & Jerry’s offers. It’s my go to ice cream in the supermarket. The only problem is that it’s so inconsistent! Lately I’ve only gotten mostly chocolate ice cream, barely any marshmallow inside the pints (which is my favorite part). Last batch I had didn’t have any graham cracker or marshmallow. I don’t want to give up on this product but I just wish they could get it right! Will not be buying for a while, maybe the wait will be worth it..\n",
            "My favorite flavor! Lately I haven’t been able to find it anywhere. I want s’more!!!\n",
            "Amazing, miss this flavor so much. All things s’mores from B&J I miss desperately\n",
            "I honestly don't know what Ben and Jerry's was thinking with this concoction. The balance between the traditional s'mores flavors (graham cracker, chocolate, and marshmallow) in this pint is completely off. It ends up tasting like plain chocolate ice cream. Now Ben & Jerry's has come out with an additional s'mores flavor. But why? Just revamp this one! Probably the most disappointing pint of ice cream I've ever bought.\n",
            "I love this ice cream SO much! By far my favorite!\n",
            "I'm a die-hard B&J's fan, but they really got it wrong with this one. When I got it I first thought something was wrong because it only tasted like chocolate ice cream with nothing else -- but then I saw the rest of the reviews here and I guess it's just the flavor! I was really excited for the graham crackers but I they're practically non existent. I'm pretty disappointed, hopefully the rest of the flavors don't lose their character like this o\n",
            "First off, I love Ben and Jerrys.\n",
            "I always love trying all your different flavors and was pretty excited to try this! But I could not taste anything but chocolate, good chocolate ice cream nonetheless. I would consider tweaking this recipe I could visibly see all the marshmallow swirl which seemed abundant but the chocolate ice cream base is to strong to even taste the other flavors.\n",
            "Usually this is my favorite flavor, have been treating myself every few months to S'mores for years. The one I bought today though, I almost thought it was a different product. Could barely see any marshmallow, the chocolate was overpowering, and I got a feeling I was eating condensed milk or something at times instead of anything s'mores related. I hope this was just a bad batch and not a permanent change :\\\n",
            "This is the only ice cream I'll eat. It's literally my favorite. I would eat it all the time if it were easier to find in stores! They stocked it where I used to live and ever since I moved I haven't been able to find It which makes me so sad. Ben and Jerrys, distribute it more! it's heaven in a pint and I miss it SO MUCH.\n",
            "(p.s. \"Gimme S'mores is NOT as good AT ALL. Pales in comparison.\n",
            "I was really excited to get this for my wife since she loves chocolate and marshmallow and I thought this would be a match made in heaven with B&J being her favorite ice cream brand, but lo and behold this was probably the most underwhelming flavor to date. Tasted like a decent chocolate ice cream but other than that it was generic and didn’t have much of a s’mores taste to it.\n",
            "I just bought this thinking I’d love it and it could not be the furthest thing from s’mores. It’s pure chocolate ice cream; very strong and dark chocolate to say the least. Cannot even even see, let alone taste, the marshmallow or the graham cracker.\n",
            "Did not like this one bit. Chocolate was a bad idea for this ice cream. The picture and description are very deceiving. P\n",
            "Omg! This is the BEST ice cream you’ll ever have. It’s hard do find. They don’t even have it at their own ice cream shop. Gimme s’more is nothing like it - I wouldn’t even buy that. “S’mores” is the best! I hope they keep making it. It’s smooth and not too sweet. The chocolate flavor is awesome combined with graham crackers and marshmallows!! I LOVE this ice cream!!!\n",
            "Been buying this chocolaty delight since my daughter was a toddler.....and she's now a licensed driver. This decadent flavor is my before-bed ritual. Smooth rich deep chocolate flavor with delicious fudge chunks and swirls of lip-smacking goodness. None of your other flavors compare to this delight. S'mores will always have a place in my heart.....and freezer.\n",
            "I have been a Ben and Jerry’s lover since childhood. With that being said it is rare that I come across a flavor that I am not a fan of. Being that I love Ben and Jerry’s as well as s’mores, I was really excited to try this. The base flavor was fine but I was not reminded of s’mores while eating this. I actually didn’t even finish the pint, which never happens.\n",
            "I would expect a S'mores flavored ice cream to taste like my favorite dessert ever, a S'more. What I ended up getting was an overpowered chocolate flavor with tiny hints of graham cracker and even more chocolate in the form of the fudge chunks. I'm pretty disappointed in this flavor as usually I love B&J ice cream. Definitely won't be purchasing this again.\n",
            "This is my all-time favorite Ben & Jerry’s flavor. They changed it up a bit sometime in the last couple of years, but it’s still very delicious. It has become increasingly difficult to find since the introduction of “Gimme S’more” (which I do not enjoy half as much), so when I do manage to find it, I stock up. Perfect flavor combination, not to be missed.\n",
            "I am a S'mores fanatic, so once I saw this in the grocery store, I went crazy! Lol I was expecting a marshmallow based ice cream with a fudge swirl and Graham cracker and fudge chunks. Unfortunately, I found myself eating chocolate flavored ice cream. The Smores flavor was overpowered by the chocolate smh I tried, but it was nothing that I was expecting.\n",
            "My current favorite flavor! I love the creamy marshmallow swirls and the sandy texture of graham cracker crumbs, plus chocolate chunks. Some people feel it's not \"balanced\" enough, but as a chocolate person I'm perfectly happy to have my s'mores be more chocolate than anything! It's as if you took your s'more and crumbled it in chocolate ice cream!\n",
            "This flavor is just PERFECTION for me! The dark chocolatey ice cream base is stellar, the gritty swirls of almost wet sand textured graham cracker is SO GOOD and the touches of toasted marshmalllow swirled throughout just top it off perfectly. I will never survive if they get rid of this flavor. I hat when I can’t find it in stock!\n",
            "Hey stores in Delaware - if you want my grocery business you had better start stocking this flavor. My favorite used to be chocolate and peanut butter ice cream. But once I tried Smores I find myself driving around until I find a store that carries it. Do yourself a favor - if you have not tried this flavor - do so now.\n",
            "I absolutely love everything about this flavor. The chocolate base is the best. B&J has very few flavors with chocolate base and no nuts.\n",
            "My only problem is that NONE of the stores around me carry it anymore. They all carry the new S'mores flavor - which isn't chocolate ice cream. Sad ice cream-less summer for me.\n",
            "My wife and I treat ourselves to Ben and Jerry’s on Friday nights. We used to buy S’mores and share it every Friday for 8 years!!! We can’t find it anywhere in North Carolina anymore. None of the other flavors are even close to comparing. Very sad that we can’t get it. It’s not even available in the online store.\n",
            "I was excited to see my store finally selling the s’mores flavor so I obviously bought it. I started eating it today and it’s just chocolate ice cream with a little bit of graham cracker and almost no marshmallow. I won’t be buying this again but I will recommend my favorites: Cherry Garcia and The Tonight Dough\n",
            "I feel like they really dropped the ball with this flavor. The marshmallow and Graham crackers are entirely overpowered by the chocolate ice cream and chunks of fudge. I had really high hopes for this one. I think it would be so much better with a Graham flavored ice cream or even a marshmallow one.\n",
            "I had high expectations for this ice cream as I love anything s'more flavor, but this ice cream just didn't cut it. It literally just tasted like chocolate ice cream. No graham cracker or marshmallow flavor at all. Sorry Ben & Jerry's, love your ice cream, but this flavor could use some work\n",
            "This flavor is my favorite because of the graham cracker swirls; they are to die for. This is always my ice cream go to and I am so sad that s'mores isn't sold at most ben&jerrys retailers. I have such a hard time finding it these days that I usually am forced to settle for other flavors.\n",
            "Insanely chocolatey. Needs more marshmallow and graham crackers because all I could taste was chocolate.\n",
            "Not your typical summer treat flavor...the chocolate ice cream is overpowering and the taste of graham cracker and marshmallow bits is non-existent. Very disappointed by our choice of ice cream. Ben & Jerry's is known for exceptional and creative flavors, but this one misses the mark.\n",
            "Tastes nothing like s'mores. Such dark chocolate ice cream...i don't understand why it has fudge, as s'mores do not...the marshmallow is not enough to help the overpowering darkness of the ice cream, and the graham doesn't taste at all, just contributes a sandy texture. Hard pass.\n",
            "The Dutch chocolate base is DELICIOUS, and the occasional bites of crumbled graham cracker, marshmallow, and chocolate just make it that much better. Purists may prefer more \"S'mores\" flavor, as the chocolate ice cream is really bold, but I think it's beyond excellent as is.\n",
            "I am always on the hunt for this flavor when we visit a grocery store. I can’t get enough of the rich chocolate, buttery graham cracker, marshmallow swirl and chocolate pieces. I try so hard to ration it out, but I’m usually done in 4-5 nights. Thx for the yummy creation!\n",
            "I was excited to try the smores....but the chocolate overpowered everything.\n",
            "This is one of Ben & Jerry's most disappointing flavors. It tastes like nothing but chocolate ice cream. I didn't taste a single fudge chunk or roasted marshmallow it it. and that graham cracker swirl was non-existent. I'm shocked this hasn't made it to the graveyard yet.\n",
            "As a chocolate ice cream, it's OK, but if you're going to call an ice cream smores, it should at least taste like smores. This is nothing but chocolate. I barely see any marshmallow,and I don't know where the graham crackers are supposed to be. Pretty disappointing.\n",
            "S'mores has been my favorite flavor for YEARS. I love the chocolate base and the surprise of the marshmallow and graham cracker swirls within. Lately I haven't been able to find it in stores very often. Please don't send to the flavor graveyard. I would seriously cry.\n",
            "I just opened my pint, when I took off the lid, I saw marshmallow, I was excited. But after I got threw that small layer of marshmallow, I couldn't find anymore. I didn't see or taste any Graham cracker. And I only saw a few chocolate chips. I think I got a mistake!\n",
            "I bought this yesterday and I went to 4 differrrnt stores until I found it! I was so happy then when I tasted it I didn't see any marshmallow until I reached the middle and it was too much chocolate I spent over 8 bucks because I got two and I was very disappointed.\n",
            "this is my fave b&j flavor!!! however i have been seeing less and less of this flavor in stores. i hope they are trying to replace it with that horrid “gimme s’more” flavor...that flavor could never compare to this classic. please keep this flavor ben and jerry’s!!\n",
            "I read other reviews that claimed that the chocolate overpowers the other components, but I think that is what I like. Chocolate ice cream is my jam, and S'mores brings chocolate ice cream to a new level with the addition of some marshmallow and graham cracker.\n",
            "This is my FAVORITE B&J ice cream. The chocolate ice cream is so rich. The crunchy graham cracker part is yummy too. This ice cream is so hard to find in the stores so if you do find it, stock up like I do. I'm so sad that I don't have any right now.\n",
            "I bought this flavor to try because of the amazing reviews. However, I was really disappointed. There was maybe one or two graham cracker chunks and that was it. The ratios were very off. However, if you like chocolate ice cream, this is the pint for you\n",
            "I agree with a lot of reviewers that this is mostly chocolate...and could use more marshmallow...but it's still awesome. I love the flavor and texture of the graham cracker swirl. I allways get excited when I see this at my store and never pass it up.\n",
            "This is by far my favorite Ben & Jerry’s flavor! The chocolate ice cream with the graham cracker crumbs and toasted marshmallow is the perfect combination and taste just like biting into a s’more! If only it was available at more locations...\n",
            "This is what happiness tastes like. I freakin LOVE B&J s’mores! I’m pregnant right now and am so sad that I can’t find it in my local grocery stores because I am seriously craving it!!! I am mystified why Regis isn’t a Moreno popular flavor!\n",
            "So delicious, but hard to find around these parts. It is perfectly balanced between the chocolatey icecream, the marshmallows and the best of all, the graham swirls which to me seem to have a bit of saltiness... altogether, it's just yum.\n",
            "It just tasted like chocolate ice cream. I got a couple chocolate chunks but no marshmallows or graham crackers. I would never have called it was s’mores. For the price I pay, I’d like a decent amount of toppinggs mixed in. Disappointed.\n",
            "This is my favorite Ben and Jerry’s variety, no question. I don’t generally like chocolate base, but this is just perfection. Love the complements to the rich chocolate base. I could buy this every visit to the grocery store.\n",
            "Been buying this flavor for years. My favorite part is getting a big glob of marshmallow. Been having a hard time finding it in the usual stores recently but maybe they were just waiting for the weather to warm up here in PA.\n",
            "This is my favorite flavor of ice cream! It got me through many hard nights of studying in college, and now I’m a successful engineer. It was clearly the S’mores!!\n",
            "This is my all time FAVORITE flavor. I go to the shop in Glenview just to buy it. The new version does not remind me of S'mores at all. This one does! Don't stop making it, even if it's just in the shops!!! Please!\n",
            "I love anything s’mores and this was so close to being perfect. I thought it just needed more marshmallow and graham cracker so it would taste more like s’mores and less like a straight up chocolate ice cream.\n",
            "I love this flavor so so so much. I, however, can not find it ANYWHERE. This is really upsetting for me because it definitely deserves to be a more mainstream flavor, so it can be more accessible. Love it.\n",
            "This is my #1 pick ! I have to have it every other night. The graham cracker crunch and the chocolate chunks with the marshmallow taste just like s’mores and gives you that PERFECT CRUNCH ! I LOVE IT\n",
            "I remember baskin robbins having a s'mores ice cream and me wishing it had more graham crackers in it. This is what is should have been! I love,love,love this flavor so much! One of the best.\n",
            "This is hands down my favorite of all the Ben and Jerry's, I just wish it wasn't so hard to find! Also, don't be fooled by the new s'mores flavor, \"gimme s'more\" it isn't the same at all!\n",
            "This is my all-time FAVORITE ice cream of all time! I'm not usually a S'mores type of person but this ice cream is my favorite! It is so smooth, goo-ey and delicious, just like a S'more!\n",
            "This ice cream is amazing!!!! I love s'mores and this ice cream hits the spot everytime I eat it. I wish this ice cream was near me. Whenever I find it, I buy it. It's hard to find it.\n",
            "It's been my favorite flavor for years, and I used to be able to find it at my local Wawa or Quick Check. I haven't been able to find it in months and it makes me so sad.\n",
            "I loooove this ice cream flavor! It’s just so hard to find. I literally drive 38 miles for it. Gimme s’mores is carried near me but it’s such a disappointment.\n",
            "I’ve always liked Ben and Jerry’s but typically went for more traditional flavors but now this is the only one I ever want! It’s awesome 10/10 would recommend\n",
            "Not even kidding this is the best ice cream in the entire world but it is so hard to find :( I ate a half of a pint of this stuff a night for like 4-5 years.\n",
            "This is my favorite! I love the swirls of toasted marshmallow in it, it could use a tad bit more graham cracker, but overall it is extremely delicious!!!\n",
            "Bought this last Sunday. It tastes like Chocolate Ice Cream. If there was Marshmallow or Graham Cracker in it, must be tiny amount. I can't find it.\n",
            "I was excited to try this and highly disappointed that it was basically all fudge. I’ve always wanted to try B&J but I think I’ll stick to Blue Bell\n",
            "My absolute favorite flavor. I hunt for it. I’m addicted to the toasted marshmallow. I wish my grocery store would stock it but they don’t respond.\n",
            "I just recently tried S’more for the first time. It is amazing! By far my favorite flavor. Doesn’t seem to be in many stores around me though:(\n",
            "The chocolate ice cream over powers everything else. I was really hoping for gobs of marshmallow and chunks of Graham. Really disappointed:(\n",
            "This is my Favorite Ben & Jerry’s flavor. It flows so perfect the melted marshmallows the graham crackers. I’ve been in love since 2011.\n",
            "S'mores is the best,and I can't find it anymore!! They use to have \"Marsha,Marsha Marshmellow\" and I loved that one but its discontinued.\n",
            "This has been my favorite ice cream for years! No other brand seems to make s’mores flavored ice cream as good as Ben and Jerry’s does.\n",
            "My Favorite combo ice cream in the world. I use to get this when it was called Marsha Marsha Mashmello! So happy they brought it back.\n",
            "Just bought this on a whim and fell in love with it only thing would be more gram cracker that crunchiness is amazing thank you\n",
            "This is the best ice cream flavor ever!!! I have zero interest in trying any other flavors. It’s smores or nothing for me!!\n",
            "This is my favorite ice cream ever! I am a chocolate lover and the mix of marshmallow cream and gram cracker is so yummy♥️\n",
            "This should be a flavor found in every store that sells B&J. It’s easily the best flavor. Nothing like it in the world.\n",
            "I bought this last night and was disappointed. Just tastes like chocolate ice cream- no marshmallows or graham taste.\n",
            "More like cookies and cream than s’mores. Disappointing. No marshmallow chunks or graham cracker, no toasty flavor.\n",
            "This is my absolute favorite flavor of ice cream, not just Ben & Jerry's! So hard to find, but absolutely amazing!\n",
            "This is my absolute favorite flavor! It has the best graham cracker (taste and texture) and great chocolate!\n",
            "This is my absolute favorite flavor. I hate that it’s impossible to find in stores or online. Bring it back!!\n",
            "My favorite. I buy all I can find when I go to the grocery store. As a result I keep buying bigger shirts.\n",
            "This is the most delicious ice cream flavor I’ve ever tasted, Ben and Jerry’s or otherwise! Must try!!!!!!\n",
            "This is my go to ice cream when I can’t decide a flavor. I love the graham cracker and marshmallow swirl.\n",
            "I love smores everything but this ice cream just tastes like chocolate. So disappointing, what a waste.\n",
            "This has to be one of my all time favorite flavors! But it's now totally impossible to find now :(\n",
            "When this was in stores I bought it all summer long. I'm hoping this will come back on the market\n",
            "The perfect s'mores ice cream, it is a great late night snack and I never want to share my pint\n",
            "I loveeeee this ice creammmmm. Please gettt! I love the flavor and there ice is just the best!\n",
            "This is my absolute favorite Ben and Jerry’s flavor. This dethroned Chubby hubby as my fav.\n",
            "This flavor is my absolute favorite. It is my go-to pick and I'm so glad it exists.\n",
            "I wish they would bring this version back to the stores or sell it in gallon tubs!\n",
            "This is my favorite ice cream of all time. I’ve been obsessed with it for years.\n",
            "This is one of the most addictive to date. The graham cracker swirl is heavenly\n",

            "This is hands down one of the best flavors I’ve had. I could eat it every day.\n",
            "By far my favorite flavor. I'm always bummed when it's sold out at the store.\n",
            "It's the only ice cream I like. The bad reviews are just freak bad batches.\n",
            "Love this flavor!! Love the marshmallow graham cracker combo.\n",

            "It was way to much chocolate I hated it !!!!!!!!!!\n",
            "This is absolutely the best ice cream flavor ever - from B&J or any ice cream company, period. I believe it has been discontinued because I cannot find it at any of my area grocery stores.\n",
            "I bought this a couple days ago and am obsessed! However I'm scared because it says exclusive flavor and I've never loved one of your flavore this much (which is saying something!!!!) What can I do to make sure you keep it???\n",
            "I just bought this today! The most perfect Ben and Jerry blend and I have been trying all of them! Im also sad/scared that its an exclusive flavor. Please don't take it away from me.\n",
            "I love this flavor! I got it on a whim and I'm so glad it paid off!! I hope they come out with slices next! This is hands down my favorite one!! I'm over here trying not to eat the whole thing in one sitting.\n",
            "Only suggestion is a little more almond flavor/slices (or chocolate covered almonds) in the pint. Either way, I love it!\n",
            "This was reccomended to me last night at a store in napa and I don't write reviews for much but I had to for this one. Hands down the best ice cream I've ever had. Sweet, salty, creamy and crunchy and the best flavor ever. I hope I can find it in stores! Love love love it!\n",
            "First Time Trying This Flavor and Must Again Say, \"Spectacularly Delicious!\"\n",
            "I sent a request in for an ice cream similar to this one (except I named it Rich n Thicc) and ending up stumbling into this flavor while on vacation in Colorado and it made my heart so happy but most of all it was absolutely DELICIOUS!!! thank you for this amazing flavor, please make it a permanent one!!!\n",
            "I bought this flavour for a friend who loves salted caramel and fell in love! I feel like the name just doesn’t do justice to the deliciousness within. Crunchy almonds, crispy chocolate, and caramel swirls that aren’t overly sweet - just perfection!\n",
            "This is my first review and honestly I never thought that I'd ever write a review on a Ben and Jerrys flavor. However, this flavor is awesome. Great flavor of the salted caramel, texture from the almonds and all around awesome. Keep it.\n",
            "I bought this a few weeks ago, and I became obsessed! I went back to the store though, and it wasn't there (exclusive flavor?) Hope they bring it back... it's the only one I like!!!!\n",
            "Wanted to try something other than my favorite coffee flavor and I was shocked at how much I loved this ice cream. I honest would choose it over coffee flavor which has been my fav for 10+ yrs. I wish I could buy stock in this flavor just to make sure you never stop selling it. Please keep this flavor. I can't express enough how happy I am to have something I know will always please me. KEEP THIS FLAVOR AVAILABLE!\n",
            "Found this Diamond in Safeway Kauai, Hawaii\n",
            "I have always enjoyed Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, but most of the time, they are a bit too sweet for my taste. The Salted Caramel Almond is perfect. It is sweet, obviously, but not overwhelming. I almost couldn't stop myself from eating the whole pint in one sitting. This flavor needs to be added to the regular rotation!\n",
            "Not sure what to make out of this flavor. The ingredients say almond slivers. What I got was more like crushed almonds or small almond pieces. They gave the ice cream a 'gritty' texture which was not pleasing to my tongue nor teeth. Not sure if I got a 'crazy' batch but doubt if I will try again.\n",
            "I've been quite reluctant to try B&J ice cream, because it always appeared to have flavors that didn't quite appeal to me. Well...you got me, you finally got me! This Salted Caramel Almond...whew!! Awesomeness!!! Please don't take this away.\n",
            "This is my absolute favorite flavor! Great combination. I would even be happy without the chocolate bits in there because the ice cream with almonds paired with the caramel is amazing on its own. PLEASE never get rid of this flavor!!!\n",
            "I bought the salted caramel almond because I love salted caramel. The one I purchased really lacked caramel. It was more vanilla ice cream with slivered almonds and chocolate chunks. Did I just purchase a dud?\n",
            "This is the ONLY flavor I ever buy, and over the past 2 weeks NOWHERE has it anymore and I am sooo upset! I’m assuming it was discontinued since its an exclusive flavor?? Please keep it forever!!!!\n",
            "Perfect amount of everything. Not too much caramel, not too much chocolate. But best of all are the almonds. Just slivers but they make a big impact.\n",
            "This might be my new favorite Ben and Jerry’s flavor. I love the big chocolate chunks and lots of almonds!\n",
            "This is a fabulous one! My absolute favorite flavor, hands down! Send it to more places in San Francisco!\n",
            "Ben and Jerry’s really got this one right. By far my favorite that they’ve ever made. Keep it up guys!!\n",
            "I love this one. The caramel and almonds are so yummy, and it’s not too chocolatey. So good.\n",
            "This tastes great. wonderful product. 10/10 i would definetly buy this product again\n",
            "I give it a 4 star only because I think they should put more strawberries . Flavor is very good but lacks the fact that is strawberry cheesecake and it is a bit pricey.\n",
            "This ice cream is breath takingley good!! It taste just like a cheesecake with fresh strawberries in it. I'm so happy to have found this kind because I make a lot of homemade shakes for my family especially on the weekend and when I brought this home for the first time I fixed them some on a Friday night and I looked and it was gone on Saturday night. That's how much they liked it and still like it, I put it in the back part of the freezer and put something in front of it so it will last longer than a day. Lol! I would highly recommend this brand and flavor of icecream to everyone and I will definitely be buying more of it!\n",
            "Strawberry Cheesecake flavor was one of the first I ever tried from Ben and Jerry's, and I loved it.\n",
            "I’m convinced this flavor of ben and jerry’s will create world peace. I hope it comes in slices/bar form or any other kind! NEED TO STOCK MY FREZER FULL! i eat this while binging netflix!\n",
            "Im a Huge Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream fan! Its been my favorite brand for as long as i can remember and Im lucky enough to be one of the few places with a B&J's ice cream shop. But this flavor in particular has been my go to for years. Very rarely do i switch it up( unless its a different cheesecake flavor) . they really hit the nail on the head with this one. I have yet to find another brand of cheesecake ice cream that even comes close to comparison with B&J's. Their ice creams are usually around 5-7 bucks for a pint depending on if you get it at a grocery store or a convenience store but its worth the money.\n",
            "I have been absolutely in love with this stuff every since the first time I tried it about 7 years ago. I have tried other brands of strawberry cheesecake ice cream when the store was out of ben & jerry's brand, and Ben & Jerry's is far superior to those because most of them use a strawberry jelly-like swirl instead of actual chunks of strawberry like Ben & Jerry's.\n",
            "I love the idea of a strawberry cheesecake ice cream, but only one of those components really shine here. The strawberry flavor greatly overpowers the cheesecake, resulting in what tastes like a sweeter strawberry ice cream than a true hybrid. The graham cracker crumbs are a stand out, but even then, there's not quite enough. A decent flavor.\n",
            "Oh my God this is a problem! This ice cream is sooo freaking good I wanna cry! I've walked past this flavor so many times thinking it would be blah. Well is not... it doesn't taste super intense like cheesecake, it a more creamy and sweet taste that's slightly different but way better. Almost like a strawberry milkshake. It has frozen dry strawberries in it and huge chunks of tasty Graham crackers. I literally can't get enough!\n",
            "This used to be my favorite. I haven't had it in 5 years so when I saw that it had come back I didn't waste any time splurging on it. It tastes almost the same but feels really thick and weird. That's probably because the cheesecake pieces were replaced with cheesecake flavored ice cream. I'm so disappointed.\n",
            "I'm a huge Ben & Jerrys fan, half baked was always my go to flavor since I'm a chocolate fan. However, my boyfriend started getting strawberry cheesecake and after one bite, I'll never get any other flavor again. It's delicious, the graham crackers complete it. Would definitely recommend trying it! So refreshing.\n",
            "I agree, very yummy, but need to double the amount of Graham cracker in it! Would be 5 stars if that happened!\n",
            "I am a huge cheesecake fan, so obviously had to try this flavor. And I gotta say, I was definitely not disappointed. The base tastes so much like cheesecake..there's the perfect amount of strawberries throughout..and the graham swirl is just enough to be like a crust. Everything about this flavor is perfect. I'm one who almost always adds some type of syrup for a topping, but this one doesn't need anything!\n",
            "This is my favorite but I would love it even more if there was more crust in the ice cream. Sometimes I may get a pint and there is really no crust at all in it...\n",
            "I'm in love with the crust part like little crumbles with strawberries and a vanilla ish ice cream, so it's like heaven in your mouth. I wish there was a little more of the crumble part in the ice cream cause it's not proportioned right. Keep killin it. Hope this helps\n",
            "I usually go for Chocolate Fudge Brownie or Half Baked because I'm a chocolate freak. My husband brought home Strawberry Cheesecake for me, because our store was out of the other two, and OMG, this stuff is amazing! Definitely my new favorite! I ALWAYS have a pint on hand because I can't live without it! This ice cream seriously makes me happy when I'm down!\n",
            "I’ve been eating the same flavor of ben & jerry’s ice cream for the last five years, with the occasional pint of chunky monkey, and the strawberry cheesecake flavor is my absolute flavor. it’s never done me wrong i just love the little bits of graham cracker. keep doing what you’re doing ben & jerry’s\n",
            "This is good, but the graham cracker isn't very thick and it no longer has the cheesecake pieces. When eating it, it feels like it's missing something.\n",
            "This use to be my favorite. Lately it seems like they have no graham cracker though. Disappointing....\n",
            "This is the best Ben and Jerry’s flavor in my opinion. Oh my gosh, I have to buy it a lot because it’s heavenly! However, I wish there were more strawberry bits.\n",
            "I love the flavors soaring through this wonderful ice cream! Fresh strawberry and graham crust swirls all in a tasty cheesecake ice cream. So delicious!\n",
            "This is my absolute favorite ice cream. It's delicious. I especially love the graham cracker swirl. I don't know how they do it but I'm glad they do. :D\n",
            "One day I had a craving a strawberry cheesecake and was gonna get a shake that would have sufficed but was meh. We went to the grocery store and I found this. Next thing I know I was stocking up on this flavor. It’s sooo goood! Omg!\n",
            "THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST FLAVOUR I HAVE EVER TASTED. I NEED THIS TO BE AVAILABLE IN PINTS IN CANADA. I BELIEVE IT WOULD SELL WELL. BY SELL WELL I MEAN I WILL PROBABLY BUY EVERY SINGLE PINT AVAILABLE IF I COULD.\n",
            "I bought this yesterday and managed to finish the wholle pint. This is by far one of my favorite Ben And Jerry's Ice cream flavors so far. If I could change anything I would add more strawberries.\n",
            "I've been eating this for years and each time I eat this ice cream I fall in love all over again. Strawberry Cheesecake Ice cream is the very best. My favorite, I love this Ice Cream!!!!!!!\n",
            "I was really excited to try this flavor because I've never met a Ben and Jerry's product I haven't loved. Unfortunately there is a first time for everything. The graham cracker and cheesecake flavors are so over powering you get no strawberry flavor. The result is so sickly sweet. There is no balance. Really bummed out!\n",
            "I bought this at target and at first I was overjoyed with how tasty it was but then I realized that my ice cream was half empty literally the bottom half was air\n",
            "The flavor and premium quality ingredients are definitely superb except for the strawberries. They suck! Horrible texture! They gotta go! I spit them out when I eat this flavor.\n",
            "I'm usually go with Half-baked or American Dream Cone, but this one wins. The graham cracker swirl is it brings it all together.\n",
            "I love everthjng about this ice cream I actually wish it had more graham cracker swirl in it it’s so perfect highly addictive\n",
            "Cheesecake flavor isn’t very strong but the strawberry and crust crumble is delicious\n",
            "My #1 go too! I'd eat it all in one sitting but then I'd be sad when it's gone. ;)\n",
            "This is a great flavor! The ice cream base is rich and sweet without being over the top, and the flavor is natural, not cheap and artificial like some other brands going after the same cheesecake profile. The strawberry mix-Ins are very yummy. It really hits the spot when you’re looking for strawberry cheesecake without wanting to eat actual cheesecake, unless you have a few scoops next to a slice of cheesecake... that sounds good so I’ll be back a little later :)\n",
            "Favorite Ice Cream of theirs. Tastes vary good. Try it.\n",
            "Its so delcious and super amazing and sooooo gooddd\n",
            "By far my favorite Ben & Jerry’s. Truly delicious.\n",
            "Ate about a quarter of this. So far i got the cheesecake and grahams. Still no strawberry, kinda missing the main ingredient.\n",
            "I love love love cheesecake flavored ice cream but this strawberry cheesecake did not live up to my standards at all. I was disappointed in this flavor as I love Ben and Jerry’s ice cream!\n",
            "This would be my favorite flavor if it actually had cheesecake bits or cheesecake flavor ice cream... all you get are strawberries and graham crackers. Not my idea of cheesecake at all.\n",
            "The very first flavor of Ben & Jerry's, will always be a favorite. I think a lightly sweeten strawberry puree swirled in would be great compared to the strawberry chunks.\n",
            "this is my new favorite ice cream. tbh it doesn’t have an extreme cheesecake flavor, but the strawberry and the graham cracker swirl is to die for. the graham cracker tasted like a real pie crust. the ice cream does taste a little bit like cheesecake but it’s not overpowering. everything about it is delicious.only suggestion would be to add more strawberries.\n",
            "This one is another old favorite from B&J. I just wrote about how I first fell in love with B&J because of chocolate fudge brownie, so this is probably the second flavor I fell in love with. I also forgot how good this was until I got it on a Royal Caribbean cruise a few years ago and I started getting it again. It's a flavor that I will always come back to.\n",
            "This is exactly how I remember it! Cheesecake and graham crackers bring this to life.\n",
            "If grass is green and the earth is round, then this is Ben and Jerry's...nay...the world of dessert's best flavor of all time. OF. ALL. TIME. The truth is, no one else makes anything like this - the strawberry is juicy and the graham cracker bits are buttery. If heaven were a place on earth, it would be found at the bottom of this pint.\n",
            "This is the best ice-cream ever!!! Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite flavor and not too many brands make this flavor or does it taste this great. But Ben & Jerrys has the best tasting Strawberry Cheesecake flavor ice-cream ever with really cheesecake chunks in it. I highly recommend this flavor and brand because its the best!!!\n",
            "The only ice cream I really like is Ben & Jerrys, their ice cream is just the best to me. This flavor which I dont even know if they make anymore as its not sold by me anymore and the chocolate chip cookie dough are my favorite. This one definitely tastes like a strawberry cheesecake in ice cream its so so good and I miss it\n",
            "This remains one of my all time favorites. The texture of this ice cream is amazing and Ben and Jerry's gets it right with the mixture of flavors. The sweet cream of the cheesecake ice cream. The cool strawberries combined with the saltiness of the graham cracker crust is an amazing flavor profile and the perfect spoonful.\n",
            "Probably my favorite ice cream flavor to date. It's hard to resist eating the entire tub when it's so delicious. I love the bits of strawberry and cheesecake in this; in particular, the cheesecake is so freaking delicious. The ice cream itself is sweet and creamy and is really good overall. Would absolutely buy again.\n",
            "I really like Strawberry Cheesecake in any ice cream but this was delicious if you enjoy real tasting strawberries. I get this product regularly because of it's simple small size, but I prefer others over this as I don't care for seeds so often. Sometimes I feel like there is no cheesecake which is also disappointing.\n",
            "This is my all-time favorite flavor from B&J! It has the perfect taste and balance of flavors. The only thing that I could say would improve this flavor is more of the graham cracker swirl as that is the best part and I am a “tunnel-digger” when it comes to eating this ice cream! Following the graham cracker swirl!\n",
            "What happened to the pieces of cheesecake? Will never purchase this again - big mistake. It appears we just overpaid for graham cracker crust cheesecake “flavored” ice cream. :( NOTHING like the pics on the container. Not something we EVER expected from Ben and Jerry‘s - shame in you - you can do SO MUCH better. :(\n",
            "Ben and Jerry’s is more on the expensive side. So I either wait till it goes on sale or unless I REALLY want it. When I buy this flavor, the pint is ONLY for me. I live that there’s real cheesecake in there. As I’m writing this review, I can taste the ice cream. One of my favorite Strawberry cheesecake ice creams,\n",
            "Strawberry cheesecake used to be one of my favorites.... but what happened to those gooey yummy sweet chunky pieces of the cheesecake!? Digging the graham cracker swirl but really miss the cheesecake pieces. It complimented the ice cream so well. Still got love for you B&J. New favorite.... Netflix and Chilled.\n",
            "O.M.G. I didn't think I would like this as much as I do, but it's so good!!! Has the right amount of strawberry pieces, cheesecake ice cream, and Graham cracker swirls, which are my favorite!!! Honestly, my favorite cheesecake ice cream. I would definitely recommend if looking for something different. So good!!\n",
            "This is my all time FAVORITE ice cream. It's so rich and smooth. The graham cracker swirl add the right amount of texture to the ice cream and the strawberry chunks are a nice treat. When I was pregnant, I literally ate this ice cream for breakfast. It's just the right amount of sweetness to curb the craving.\n",
            "This is one of my favorite ice cream flavors - great graham cracker swirl throughout plus strawberry and cheesecake pieces. It is sweet and creamy, but feels like such a treat. I have to pace myself and try to make a pint last a few times. I actually got to try this FRESH at the factory in Vermont\n",
            "Frozen heaven in a tiny little tub. Every one has their very own favorite Ben and Jerry's Ice cream flavor and this one happens to be mine. That being said. No I don't like sharing. It's a little bit pricey depending on where you buy it but when something taste's this good who cares what it cost.\n",
            "I have never been someone who could finish any ice cream serving in one sitting. But let me tell you, I can go through this within one Hour. It is truly my favorite ice cream, I am constantly repurchasing this flavor. Its not too sweet and the cheesecake bits are heavenly. Absolutely obsessed.\n",
            "Ben & Jerry's Strawberry cheesecake is delicious. It's the right amount of sweet and the graham cracker crust mixed in is my favorite part of this ice cream. It is a bit high priced so I usually only buy it once in awhile but it is definitely worth the money if you like strawberry cheesecake.\n",
            "I was recommended this ice cream many times and I finally got the chance to try it. It is sooo good. It has a nice strawberry flavor and the crust that is in it is so delicious. The crust tastes like real crust that is on a strawberry cheesecake. This is now one of my favorite ice creams.\n",
            "This flavor was my go to flavor to treat myself after exams. I love how they have mini cups since some brands don't have single serve cups. These can be affordable, but look out for sales. Overall satisfied with the flavors they carry. If you haven't had Ben & Jerry's yet, go try some!\n",
            "I literally went to the 711 store and bought this ice cream for 2 weeks straight while in college lol. It is so amazing!! I love the frozen strawberries and the cheesecake pieces. It literally taste just like your eating new your style cheesecake. So yummy and my all time favorite!\n",
            "So I hate strawberries but love strawberry flavored things and my gosh- this hits the spot. The real strawberries in it don’t even matter to me. The rest of it is so freaking good\n",
            "Ben & Jerrys will forever be my favorite brand of ice cream and this flavor will ALWAYS be my go to when I dont care about the calories! Lol but everything in moderation! This flavor has the perfect amount of cheesecake chunks to go along its the strawberry swirls. So yummy.\n",
            "This is by far my favorite Ben & Jerry's ice cream flavor. I'm a little sensitive to dairy, so I try to avoid it, but I would gladly endure a night of stomach pain for this ice cream. The day Ben & Jerry's makes a non-dairy version of this will be the best day of my life.\n",
            "This is the one icecream I can say Ive been purchasing for YEARS. Both in store and in the grocery store. Its perfect honestly. Its not too sweet, the strawberries taste fresh every time. No artificial flavor to it. Its just a great brand and this is my favorite flavor\n",
            "This is my favorite Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream! I love this ice cream soooo much! My favorite part is the real pieces of cheesecake throughout the tub! This is an ice cream where it is hard to not eat the whole pint in one sitting. Highly recommend trying this ice cream!\n",
            "What can I say about this Ben & Jerry's Ice cream creamy delicious!! the (strawberry swirl and vanilla Ice cream) just melts into your taste buds. I'm a big fan of this Ice cream Ben & Jerry's is my all-time favorite Ice cream easy on the wallet heavenly on the tongue\n",
            "usually get at the supermarket when they are 2x$5 and I try to make it last a week but with these flavors is so diffuclt to resist, just please know that the size of the container is not 1 portion, you have to split it or you will be eating a week worth of calories!\n",
            "This is by far my favorite icecream EVER. And I've eaten allot of icecream. I've tried other brands of \"strawberry cheesecake\" and none even came close. It is well worth the few dollars extra. Ben and Jerry's absolutely know how to please their customers taste buds.\n",
            "I really like strawberry flavored ice cream terralina sweet and hits the spot after dinner or when I'm having a sweet tooth I would improve this product but making a bigger container and it's my favorite ice cream brand as of forevers and it's going to stay that way\n",
            "How can you go wrong with Ben and Jerrys?! They never disappoint! If you are a cheesecake lover you have GOT to try this flavor! There are HUGE chunks of cheesecake and a perfect amount of strawberries! You wont regret cracking this open after a long day at work!\n",
            "I LOVE ice cream and these are AMAZING. These are a current favorite. I wish i had them now. I love that B&J is coming out with new candies and flavors. They are definitly affordable. I have a huge sweet tooth so this is amazing for those late night cravings.\n",
            "It literally tastes like a chilly strawberry cheesecake! I love this flavor so much because its not too sweet like the other Ben and Jerrys where its a lot of chocolate and baked goods filled in. This flavor is complex and unique yet simple at the same time.\n",
            "Ben & Jerry's straw berry cheese cake ice cream is a strong, solid offering from them. Slight hint of cheesecake and a moderate amount of strawberry. The cheese cake bits in the ice cream make it great. Would be better with more graham crackers throughout.\n",

            "If you could still buy it... It would get 10 stars. Only strawberry ice cream that doesn't make me sick. I can't believe there would discontinue a classic after 15 yrs. No more Ben and Jerry's from me until they bring it back!!! Not one penny for them\n",
            "Our favorite brand of ice cream or frozen yogurt. It can be kind of pricy but you get what you pay for. Always a lot of options as far as flavor goes; which is always a plus. We buy this a few times a month and its what we want for birthdays as well\n",
            "The only kind of Ben & Jerrys I buy. I love the way the graham crackers mix with the strawberrys and the sweet ice cream. If youre into strawberry cheesecake it doesnt really taste like one but it has a really good flavor for an ice cream version\n",

            "I LOVE this ice cream! The graham cracker swirls mixed with an almost cake batter like base is divine. Soon as you add the frozen strawberries it really sets it off. I can eat the whole thing in one sitting and wont feel a lick of guilt lol\n",
            "I love this flavor of Ben and Jerrys. I do not like chocolate that much, so I try to go for vanilla based ice creams. But usually they have bananas in them and I hate bananas, so this was the perfect flavor for me and its not super sweet.\n",

I saw another reviewer state the cookie swirl was too coarse or possibly crystallized. I love the courseness of the cookie swirl it tastes amazing and adds a different texture to all the soft goeyness. I bought and finished this ice cream in the same day. THANK YOU! I always go back to Phish Food. But this I will definitely be going back to.\n",
            "Haven't been big on icecream in my life time. Only flavor I cared for was cookies and cream. Had no idea I'd LOVE Choc flavor, and mixed with the carmel, such a divine combination. The cookie swirl is mouth watering. The cookie dough is exquisite; although țhe peanut butter dough is also scrumptious, I could live without much of it in the pint. I've gotten pints with very little of the PB dough, which is heavenly. I've also gotten pints with lots and lots of PB dough, which I find to be a bit overwhelming. Still, it's the flavor I always reach for. Still consider my FAV of all time. Thank you Ben & Jerry's, & Jimmy Fallon for perfecting a flavor so awesome.\n",
            "Honestly all I have to say is this is the best icecream I've ever had. It had gobs of amazement in it. Like wow.\n",
            "Look, I just bought this for the first time yesterday, and I have to say, I’m already addicted. This stuff is JUST. SO. GOOD. I love the cookie swirl and the peanut butter dough, I love the ice cream flavor, I love everything is what I’m saying - it’s perfect and B&J please don’t change a thing!! Everything But The... used to be my favorite flavor but they have definitely changed the formula there and I stopped buying it because all I could taste was my bitter memories of how it used to be. So glad I have a replacement flavor that I love even more!!\n",
            "I cannot stop talking to myself with my mouth full of ice cream saying, \"O my gawd, sooo good!\"\n",
            "This ice cream is to be our favorite. We probably right once a week for a year. However the last five we have purchased have had a new taste to it of some sort of fruit, and it has ruined the flavor. We waited A few weeks to that that that sent out, and then we went and bought some more , But it was still the same weird through the aftertaste. For the aftertaste doesn't belong anywhere near brownies or cookies or chocolate ice cream or Oreos. It's gross. Please change the recipe back to the original !!!!!!! We have switched to a different brand of ice cream for now.\n",
            "I purchased tonight dough a few months ago and everything about it was great. This time the PB cookie dough was horrible. It tastes almost like an artificial banana flavor or how I would image nail polish would taste. Here is a photo of the batch numbers.\n",
            "I love this ice cream more than any other ice cream on planet earth. There has never been an ice cream that compares to this... If I could keep a giant deep freezer full of The Tonight Dough I would be pretty happy. Eating it makes me feel like Unicorns Dolphins Glitter are flying around my tastebuds. This may be dramatic but it's my addiction.... I can eat it in one sitting.... Its even better as a milkshake using vanilla oat milk. I love it so much. I actually hate chocolate ice cream but this is my major exception...I used to buy this every other day.. so yeah its PERFECT. Also the money goes to a good cause when I buy.\n",
            "The first time I bought this flavor it was amazing! But the last few times the peanut butter dough has ruined it. It tastes rancid. I keep giving it chances because I love everything else about it. But I had one last night that was rancid tasting PB again and my pile of PB chunks in the end was about 1/4 of the container worth. I don't believe I'll be giving it any more chances this time.\n",
            "This ice cream is what I would heaven if it were a flavor. Send me truck loads, ASAP! Contact me for my info. :)\n",
            "This ice cream is great except for the disgusting peanut butter dough chunks that taste like eating a ball of Splenda mixed with dish soap. Seems like maybe there is a bad batch going around? The rest of the pint is great... not sure what’s up.\n",
            "I purchased Tonight Dough in a Ben and Jerry's shop hefe in Hawaii a few months ago... OMG it is the greatest flavor I have ever tasted! I am not even an ice cream person, but when I found out that my local grocery store carried the Tonight Dough in pints- I was hooked! The base of this ice cream is mostly chocolate with some caramel ice cream. Then you have globs of chocolate chip cookie and peanut butter cookie dough. There is also swirls of thick chocolate fudge and tiny chuck of chocolate sandwich cookie pieces! The best way to eat this is to let it melt a bit and swirl it all around to mix up the choclate fudge and chocolate sandwich cookie peices. Great Job Ben and Jerry's - and Jimmy Falon! Honestly the only ice cream I will eat!\n",
            "This is a great ice cream in almost every way: the ice creams are delicious and the crunchy cookie swirls are awesome. The regular cookie dough with mini chocolate chips is also delicious. I was taken aback by the \"peanut butter dough\" though - it tasted really artificial, almost a bit rancid? I ate a few and had to pick the rest out. One of my friends was eating it too and felt the same. Please consider changing the PB dough or removing it altogether.\n",
            "It's like heaven in my mouth from the first spoonful to the last.\n",
            "This is usually one of my favorite flavors. Bought some yesterday, and when I went to try it the texture was icey and rough, as though it had melted and been refrozen. Little bit disappointing.\n",
            "Natural, yet yummy.\n",
            "Hands down, my new favorite.\n",
            "If I was a food, I'd be this!\n",
            "I'm still amazed that so many components can fit into one pint. The varied cookie dough pieces have the perfect chewiness. The rich chocolate base compliments the dough, and the cookie crumbs complete the overall theme. If I can find one flaw, it's in the caramel ice cream, which is so minimal and over-powered by the chocolate base that it might as well have just been just chocolate. Still, one of B&J's best.\n",
            "I love this flavor so much, the chocolate cookie swirl is so good. The two icecream flavors are sooo good! But i did not like the peanut butter dough I had way to many chunks and not enough chocolate Chip cookie dough pieces.\n",
            "okay so for a while now i’ve been buying this ice cream as my comfort food and it is WONDERFUL!!! sometimes i eat the entire pint in one sitting because it just tastes so good. the tonight dough is probably the best ice cream i’ve ever had and my dad says the same! both of us eat a lot of ice cream too hahaha so you know it’s a big thing when we both think it’s the best ice cream ever. my dad expected it to be overwhelming bc there’s a lot in it but we both agree everything works together harmoniously. my boyfriend loves it too!!! amazing ice cream, never gonna stop buying it :)\n",
            "Words cannot describe how delicious this flavor is. The cookie swirl along with the never ending chunks of cookie dough is absolutely amazing!\n",
            "The Tonight Dough from Ben and Jerrys is super sweet and 100% for cookie dough lovers! It is a little bit too rich for my liking but its still freaking delicious! They price isnt terrible depending where you get it either.\n",
            "I used to be a Chubby Hubby or nothing kind of ice cream fan...this topped it. I’m so glad I gave it the opportunity. I chose to try it because of the ingredients and for Jimmy Fallon, he’s awesome! Great creation!\n",
            "I'm so disappointed because I wanted to try this one for a long time. Well, I'm gonna have to agree with everyone who complained about the peanut butter cookie dough. I can't even describe the taste, but it's certainly not peanut butter. Yuck!\n",
            "I really liked most of this one. The ice creams taste great as do all the mix-ins, except the peanut butter cookie dough, which has an extremely strange flavor, and not peanut buttery. It’s kind of frustrating because the rest of it is SO good. I’ll probably stick with Half Baked instead of getting this one again.\n",
            "My mom bought this for me and I love the flavors, especially the cookie dough. It has a nice soft feel in your mouth and goes well with the chocolate and vanilla.\n",
            "This flavor didn't live up to my expectations. I did taste any caramel ice cream flavor, and the peanut butter cookie dough had a weird artificial flavor.\n",
            "I have been trying really hard to stay away from ice cream but saw this on the shelf and thought I have to try it. Boy was I disappointed. First I almost bent my spoon in half trying to break into the ice cream but that was because the cookie dough took over everything. There was hardly any ice cream in this. The dough pieces were very dry and not tasty at all. I really wish I could have liked this one. $5.00 in the garbage.\n",
            "I've been dying to try this flavor and after trying a couple not so great flavors i decided it was time. it was the best decision of my entire life. if you only eat one ice cream for the rest of your life, let it be \"the tonight dough\". the dough chunks are not \"chunks\", they're insanely huge, like nearing nestle Toulouse premade dough size. the ice creams are so good and it's just amazing. i wish they sold this one in a barrel because one pint is just not enough!\n",
            "I bought this with high hopes but the peanut butter cookie dough is disgusting. Everything else is fine with it except that. It tastes NOTHING like peanut butter cookie dough. Pretty unhappy considering how much this stuff costs....\n",
            "Tasted this flavor today @ the factory in Vermont. Hope they introduce it in Holland!!!\n",
            "The first time I tried this ice cream it was amazing! I thought it was my new favorite. The second time I tried it it hardly had any cookie dough in it at all and was mostly ice cream. Then the third time I bought it it was loaded with cookie dough (yay) but was mostly all the peanut butter dough which made it too peanut buttery for me. I'm not sure why it would be inconsistent because I've never had that experience with other Ben and Jerry flavors.\n",
            "I was never really a big fan of ice cream but that was long before I bought my first pint of 'The Tonight Dough'. Ever since I took a spoonful of this heavenly creation, I've been addicted to eating it. Being a girl is tough for about a full week, once a month. I can now happily spend that week eating this ice cream. It's my guilty pleasure. Thank you, Jimmy Fallon for helping to create the single best thing that makes life worth living.\n",
            "Had a craving for some ice cream and hadn't had some B&J's in a while...picked up 'The Tonight Dough' at my local Walmart...when I cracked it open and took my first bite, I fell in love!! I love Jimmy Fallon and I love ice cream...you took my 2 favorite things and put them together!! Quick question: Did he REALLY come up with this combo, cuz if he did, tell him he hit a home run with it!!....and please don't stop making/selling it!!!\n",
            "It was mostly good except the peanut butter cookie dough had yucky aftertaste. My husband agreed. Unfortunately most of the chunks were peanut butter so we both had significant collections at the bottom of our pints. Normally I like anything sweet but they really were a bit nasty. The rest was delicious.\n",
            "Tried this one for the first time tonight after many glowing recommendations from my girlfriend. I can't believe I waited so long to try this batch of heaven! The cookie dough and peanut butter offer a delightful chewy texture and flavor alternate with the ice chocolate and caramel ice cream.\n",
            "I can’t find this in my stores for the last week! It’s constant,y sold out. I may have to put on a disguise and sneak into another county! I need more!\n",
            "This ice cream is soooo great! It would almost say it is my favorite however the PB cookie dough has an add taste to it that makes it undesirable. Almost a freezer burnt taste. I would recommend a new recipe for the dough. Otherwise, it is great!\n",
            "This was my first ever Ben & Jerrys ice cream and I am definitely a repeat customer of this ice cream! I dont think this ice cream could get better! Its is sooo delicious and I recommend it to everybody! I had first seen this Ice cream on the tonight show and I kinda thought it was a joke until I saw it at a gas station I quickly picked it up, purchased it, and on the way home with a plastic spoon I found (still in its plastic) I opened it up and enjoyed on the way home. It was sooo good! I have since bought 3 more containers.\n",
            "I was really enjoying this one up until I tasted a bit of the peanut butter dough. It tastes rancid. :( I thought perhaps it was that one piece, but sure enough it tasted the same when i found another piece! Bummer. It would've gotten 5 stars from me had it not been for those funky PB dough bits, yuck! Everything else in it was fabulous.\n",
            "Is it? Heaven in a pint? Seriously... Best icecream I have ever had. I Really hope it never gets discontinued... I live in Kauai, Hawai'i only Walmart sells It. Its now the only icecream I'll eat!\n",
            "I bought this to try as my store was out of my usual flavor and it was absolutely horrible. The chunks with peanut butter in it were gritty (like sand gritty) and tasted nothing like peanut butter, they made me gag and I had to spit it out. I spent the rest of my time eating this, picking out and trying to avoid the nasty peanut butter bits but eventually threw out about half of a container. I'm a peanut butter addict and this tasted nothing like any peanut butter I've ever had! Will not repurchase ever.\n",
            "Favorite. Flavor. Ever. This pint is for those ultimate ice cream lovers. This isnt for a cheat meal...save this for a cheat DAY, because you will not want to stop eating it once you break the seal. It is gloriously excessive in all the right ways: every single bite has loads of cookie dough, peanut butter, brownie, or chocolate cookie chunks, and the ice cream itself is swirled with more chocolate indulgence. Me and my husband buy a pint apiece because we have failed many times to share nicely!\n",
            "Absolutely my favorite Ben and Jerry's ice cream flavor so far. I have yet to find another mouth-watering ice cream flavor that will impress me. I will be trying your new non dairy products very soon. Thanks for the creativity.\n",
            "O love this ice cream sooo much is sooo good the only thing I hate is the peanut butter in it but the rest is all good I love the chocolate flavor the cookie dough in it and vanilla ice cream is just delicious\n",
            "Pb cookie dough was terrible. Had to force it down\n",
            "Really strange. I thought this sounded great, but the textures and flavors don't compliment each other at all. The major problem is how overpowering the chocolate is: too much raw cocoa flavor. It's way too rich for all those mix-ins. The peanut butter dough is floury and almost sickly sweet, very artificial. There's absolutely no flavor to the chocolate chip cookie dough after being doused in their chocolate base. The cookie core is oddly coarse and, in places, kind of icy.\n",
            "The cookie doughs in this pint are better than I've ever tasted in other flavors. I think in particular it's the peanut butter cookie dough that WOWed me to death. The sweet caramel ice cream and the less sweet chocolate ice cream balance quite nicely. Before I tried it, I wrote \"The Tonight Dough\" off as too busy and probably not good, but now it's def like my favorite Ben & Jerry's. I can't get enough of the two cookie doughs with the chocolate ice cream.\n",
            "In love\n",
            "I've been a huge fan of Phish food for 15 or more years. It's been my favorite. But this blew me away. I saw another reviewer state the cookie swirl was too coarse or possibly crystallized. I love the courseness of the cookie swirl it tastes amazing and adds a different texture to all the soft goeyness. I bought and finished this ice cream in the same day. THANK YOU! I always go back to Phish Food. But this I will definitely be going back to.\n",
            "My all time favourite Ben & Jerrys ice cream is the [product:ben-&-jerrys-the-tonight-dough-ice-cream]! It is jam packed with goodness. How can someone go wrong with cookie dough, chocolate cookie swirls, and peanut butter cookie dough? I love cookie dough and this ice cream satisfying my random cookie dough cravings. I would love tubs of ice cream as a #voxbox. Definitely try it out! #sweet #sweettooth #icecream #cookie #cookiedough #peanutbutter\n",
            "Well I usually dont choose peanut butter in any of my desserts, I tried the Tonight Dough flavor because I loved Jimmy Fallon! With caramel & chocolate ice creams with chocolate cookie swirls & gobs of chocolate chip cookie dough & peanut butter cookie dough, the peanut butter flavor isnt overpowering, and the caramel ice cream is dreamy! When you feel like eating an entire carton of ice cream to make your chocolatey dreams come true, try this.\n",
            "This flavour is hands down my most favourite ice cream! Any time I have enough money, I always try to grab a pint or two because its just so dang delicious. I can't remember what turned me onto Tonight Dough, but it's been my soulmate for nearly 2 years now. If I can't find my baby, I usually settle for Half Baked, but The Tonight Dough will always be at the top of the totem pole for me. ♡♡♡♡♡\n",
            "I’m kind of a middle of the road ice cream person, I like it but not something I crave regularly... until now! I had Tonight Dough for the first time at a work function where Ben and Jerry’s catered desert . I cannot stop thinking about this ice cream. I crave it and get myself 1 pint as a treat when I grocery shop, but I could eat it every day! It’s been almost a year now and my love has only grown for this treat!\n",
            "I always buy ben and Jerrys and I tried this new type of pint and I am very offended. There was not enough ice cream as I expected in my pint. It was around half full and I was very upsset. This pint was not worth as much as I spent on it. I am a very good customer and this is my favorite ice cream and I wish this was prevented.\n",
            "I’m a big B&J fan, but The Tonight Dough doesn’t work for me. The peanut butter cookie dough tastes like it’s gone bad which is shocking because I love all things peanut butter. I also usually like having a blend of flavors, but the combo is just weird.\n",
            "Okay so when I was young I thought Ben and Jerrys was just so expensive and a treat I could not indulge in. I love ice cream and this is hands down the best store bought for me. Ben and Jerrys has a great mission and they strive to bring awareness to various social justice causes and they back it up with donations etc. anyway back to the cream man the mix ins are great salty sweet just amazing all in all\n",
            "I have legit converted 4 of my friends into craving and loving The Tonight Dough. The mix of cookie, brownie, and ice cream hits every checkmark. I have conflicting emotions in wanting and also not wanting this to come in gallon size. Not wanting a gallon cause it wouldn't last three days and wanting because it wouldn't last three days...lol\n",
            "OMG this is hands down the best flavor ever! I have bought out every pint in about a mile radius from my house. I know the shipment days. I started at 1 pint a day and now 2, I've had to compensate by adding more time at the gym but it's worth it. I love that there's no pieces of nuts they are too hard for me. I love to let it melt and sip it then eat all the dough that sunk to the bottom. Mmmmmm!\n",
            "The cookie swirl is mouth watering. The cookie dough is exquisite; although he peanut butter dough is also scrumptious, I could live without much of it in the pint. I've gotten pints with very little of the peanut butter dough, which is heavenly. I've also gotten pints with lots and lots of peanut butter dough, which I find to be a bit overwhelming. Still, it's the flavour I always reach for.\n",
            "ALL TIME FAVORITE ICE CREAM HANDS DOWN!!! It says its a caramel w dutch chocolate ice cream but it tastes like vanilla and the most delicious chocolate nice cream I have ever eaten. It has chunks of peanut butter cookie dough and chocolate chip dough. It also has chocolate cookie ribbons throughout which is the best chocolate ive ever tried. Its so creamy and rich tasting. Im addicted!!!\n",
            "The only ice cream I think surpasses rocky road in taste, texture and how well the flavors compliment each other. I recently had this because it was offered by a friend and it taste just like I remember. I haven’t bought in years because these days I only by low calorie ice cream made for dieters/slimmers. I had forgotten just how indulgent a classically US made ice cream could taste haha\n",
            "I always told myself I would NEVER buy an ice cream that costed as much as this one especially for the amount of product you get... that was until I came across this product on sale at sobeys one day. And wow, am I ever grateful for that day, this is my favourite ice cream by far! Great quality and great taste! I definitely recommend this product! Also you can often catch it on sale!\n",
            "I dunno what more you could want from your ice cream.\n",
            "I bought chocolate syrup when i bought this flavor cuz I was in the mood for chocolaty awesomeness but I didn't even end up using the syrup because the ice cream disappeared before I remembered it was there. Now I can't stop thinking about buying more. It's addictive. Which is what led me here. Yes. yes. and yes. and yes.\n",
            "Please don’t ever discontinue this flavor, it’s the absolute best. I tell all my friends and family to try Tonight Dough. If you love sweets and chocolate and peanut butter, this is for you. You have to try it and you will instantly be hooked. I can’t explain to you the happiness I get from opening the lid and getting the chocolate cookie crumble on the top layer. Heaven!!!!!\n",
            "After the first time I ever tried this ice cream, I was unable to crave any other ice cream. It honestly changed the whole game for me. I love the texture and the flavor combination. I always recommend it to all my friends and wish It was easier to find in grocery stores. Honestly, can you just sponsor me? I promise you won't find anyone more passionate about this than I am.\n",
            "Okay! Ben? Jerry? Whose wacky idea was THIS? I flippin LOVE IT. From the very first bite (wow! I shouldn’t bite ice cream it’s very COLD)\n",
            "This ice cream combines all the best parts of Ben and Jerry's including chocolate, vanilla, cookie dough and brownies. I love everything about this ice cream and there is absolutely NOTHING that I feel needs to be changed about it. I only wish that it wasn't so popular because it is sold out every time I go to the store. (kidding) keep up the excellent work Ben and Jerry.\n",
            "Ben and Jerrys is known in my family as the best Ice cream around. When a carton of half baked is placed in my freezer I know it will not last more than a week! I absolutely love this flavor! It has a perfect hint of saltiness in the dough and creamy sweetness in the ice cream! This is far superior to half baked because the different doughs in this mixture are much better!\n",
            "This is by far my favorite ice cream. Super creamy, not too rich, loads of delicious big chunks of cookie. I was surprised by the swirls of chocolate cookie. It can be a bit sandy at times but I don't mind the texture so for those adverse to it maybe it's not for you. Thank you for the wonderful ice cream B&J, this is my special go-to treat every time I want a pick me up.\n",
            "How could you not love? perfect blend of all ingredients added! Not too much of anything. I seriously have left all my other favorites behind and purchase EVERYTIME I pass the ice cream aisle and see it in stock. This satisfies every craving. I also love how vanilla is the base and everything else complements. WHO GAVE THIS ICE CREAM 1 or 2 STARS?!?!?!?! HOW!?\n",
            "The tonight dough is the SUPERIOR flavor out of all of the Ben and Jerry's flavors. If my family is getting ice cream, the tonight dough is definitely our first option. It is disappointing though because this flavor is always sold out (because it is so good). There is so much going on in one container. You must try it. You (probably) won't regret it :)\n",
            "This is my favorite ice cream of all time. Legit I get a little irrational when there isnt any left at my local store. I dont care what it costs, if I have a craving this will be put into my mouth as soon as I can possibly get it. The peanut butter chunks are enough to write your grandmother and tell her you found your soulmate. And its an ice cream.\n",
            "i usually stick with \"if i had 1,000,000 flavours\" because let's face it, it's a piece of art... however i went to my local store and tried this out for size. OMG i don't think i'll ever turn back. it makes me upset when i go to grab some and there's every other flavour other than this one! i'm addicted, please please please never get rid of this\n",
            "I bought this yesterday and I was so excited to eat it because I bought it before and loved it, but this time around there was barely any cookie swirl and there was only PB dough chunks, no cookie dough chunks. Very disappointed, might have to start sticking to half baked instead. :( not only that but this time the pb dough had a weird flavour.\n",
            "i’m a cookie dough type of girl. cookie dough ice cream is definitely my guilty pleasure. i’ve tried every brand of cookie dough ice cream. this one was alright. although it isn’t labeled as cookie dough, it’s still dough in it. i though this this one was little too sweet for me and i would prefer the dough chunks to be a little bit smaller.\n",
            "Cookie dough ice cream is one of my favorites. I love this variation of it. It has chocolate chip and peanut butter cookie dough. The chocolate mixed in with the caramel and chocolate ice cream just makes this wonderful. I usually eat this in one or 2 sittings. There is no sharing when it comes to Ben & Jerry's The Tonight Dough Ice Cream\n",
            "Its nice and creamy and the chunks give it an added boost of flavor. I usually try to control myself and tell myself that I will only get a scoop but next thing I know the pint is gone. Its reasonably priced so you can afford to stock up on a few of the favs for later. They keep really well unlike some that tend to get freezer burn easily.\n",
            "Let me get this off my chest: Jimmy Fallon is my soulmate. He just gets me. So it's only fitting that his face would be plastered on my favourite ice cream as well. This is the best combination of wanting to add all the toppings at the dessert bar but not wanting to go too far and ruining the flavour. It's the perfect balance of flavours\n",
            "This is one of my absolute favorite ice creams! Every time I see it in the store I have to buy it! My boyfriend will even surprise me with a pint of it sometimes because I love it so much. When I was really sick recently (with a sore throat) I pretty much lived off of this stuff because it was the only thing that didn't hurt to eat!\n",
            "Oh my goodness! So delicious and the perfect treat any time of the day! Some days you just need to come home and binge watch your favorite Netflix rom-coms and eat ice cream! This ice cream will make your insides feel better than any man ever could it tastes like you landed on the moon filled with all kinds of cookie dough goodness\n",
            "I love this so much, however, the last few pints I have had the regular cookie dough has not been good. I've gotten pints at different stores just to see if it was that stores batch. Have you changed the consistency of it? It was always soft and melted in your mouth. It's now kind of hard and crumbles. (does that make sense haha)\n",
            "Every once in awhile Ill treat myself to a Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream The Tonight Dough - 16oz ! Something about this particular flavor stands above the others in my opinion ! Theres so many textures and flavors coming from the two different cookie doughs! If you like chocolate, peanut butter and cookie dough... this is for you!\n",
            "While on vacation in Atlantic Beach, We stopped at the Ben & Jerry's store. My eyes were speaking to me... what's this wonderful ice cream flavor. Fresh and in a waffle bowl, PURE delight. Since we have been home. I have been looking for a place where I can get more. Because this was an awesome flavor! Thank you Ben & Jerry's\n",
            "This is a good flavor if you are a fan of cookie dough as it has two different kinds in it and its actually done correctly and taste great. Its not my first choice but I do enjoy it when I dont have my usual brand in stock at my local store. As Ive said if you are a fan of cookie dough this might be your next favorite flavor\n",
            "This is the best combination of vanilla chocolate and cookie doughI love cookie dough. I can sit and eat an entire pint. Youre able to taste and savor each flavor. You can never go wrong with a little tiny pieces of chocolate bits so good. It is a little pricey about 4 to 5 dollars for a pint but definitely worth it.\n",
            "Ben & Jerry's tonight dough is basically one of the only ice creams I will eat, it is to die for. It combineschocolateandcaramelice creams withchocolate chip cookie dough,peanut butter cookie doughand a crunchychocolatecookie swirl. It is so good! if you haven't tried it you definitely need to get some immediately!!\n",
            "This would definitely be my favorite Ben and Jerry's ice cream. I got it once to try and see if I liked it, since I'm not really an ice cream person, and I fell in love. It's one of the best flavors Ben and Jerry's offers. The two ice cream flavors and the two types of cookie dough just really complement each other.\n",
            "Let me start by saying WOW!! I had to force myself to stop eating this, or I would have consumed the whole pint. This flavor has now become my favorite! I had been looking for a tasty dairy free ice cream (Im lactose intolerant) but what the heck, Ill just take my pill before enjoying this deliciousness! Buy it!\n",
            "This flavor is a party in your mouth. Whoever thought to blend a mixture of so many chocolate favorites is a genius and deserves an award. I am a repeat customer and have purchased this pint of cream 20+ times in my lifetime. I recommend to ALL my friends. I love this flavor so much. Its 100% a guilty pleasure.\n",
            "I’ve been buying this same ice cream for years. It’s the perfect mixture of cookie dough and cookie pieces. It’s not too salty or too sweet. I can’t keep my hands from buying it off the shelves which is probably why my New Years resolution isn’t going to great lol. Nonetheless, I hope they never get rid of it.\n",
            "This is the second time I've bought this brand and it was also well worth the money. I will buy this again for sure! It's very good for that girls night out and you need that comfort food. So many yummy chunks cookie dough and peanut butter cookie dough. Satisfaction was achieved after this was consumed.\n",
            "I got to try this for my first time recently. I love the variety in there with chocolate, caramel, COOKIE DOUGH!! Anything with cookie dough has my vote. The peanut butter conflicted with the caramel just a bit too much for me, but overall super delicious. Im happy whenever I can find B&J on sale for $4!\n",
            "The perfect alternative to regular cookie dough ice cream! This has your standard chocolate chip cookie dough and peanut butter cookie dough mixed with chocolate and carmel ice cream. I gotta say my favorite part is the cookie crunch swirled in, gives you a nice crunch of texture every once in a while.\n",
            "Bought this a couple nights ago on a whim. Had seen it plenty of times when I was looking at other flavors to try out, as I'm not typically a real big chocolate ice cream fan do to the bitter taste it can have at times. But I've found that I really enjoy B&J's chocolate ice creams. Very smooth and light flavor. So I finally opted to break down and chose to buy this flavor. And have to say that I wasn't quite unsatisfied with it. I mean the chocolate and caramel ice creams came together beautifully with the chocolate chocolate chip cookie swirl. But I have to admit there was something off with the peanut butter cookie dough. I have no idea, if they taste off, do to possibly being made from a vegan recipe. But, I could very faintly taste the peanut butter as well as some kind of floral-esque note at the end. Was kind of strange tasting. I think maybe if the recipe was adjusted a bit or maybe just adding a peanut butter swirl or core to this pint, would really make everything come together.\n",
            "I recently went to a Ben & Jerry's store and purchased The Tonight Dough but in a milkshake and although I am lactose intolerant, this was one of the best decisions I made. This ice cream is AMAZING, and I would defiantly be buying it. Hope they make this flavor dairy free one day to help me out.\n",
            "Ben & Jerry are my two favorite men because not only are they SMASHING the patriarchy, but theyve been killing the ice cream game for years. This flavor is the most packed with toppings so be aware if you like simple ice creams! A cookie dough lovers dream, the cookie swirl is my favorite!\n",
            "I never thought I would be a fan of peanut butter cookie dough in an ice cream as I am really picky about where I taste peanut butter. However, they balance the flavors so well that I really enjoyed it! The carmel ice cream soon made me realize my love for caramel ice cream in genereal!\n",
            "I have had sooooooo many flavors of Ben & Jerry's throughout my life. It is an amazing brand. There's always so many goodies jam packed into one container! And there's an insane amount of choices available. This one is pretty memorable due to Jimmy Fallon's face being on the container.\n",
            "Tonight Dough is my all time favorite Ben and Jerry's flavor. The mix of ingredients is the best. It has both chocolate and caramel ice cream along with chocolate chip cookie dough, peanut butter cookie dough, and a chocolate cookie swirl. It has a lot of texture and tastes great!\n",
            "This is by far my favorite flavor! I've tried so many different flavors and they're all good. But I like this one the best because it has some saltiness along with the sweet chocolate, cake and cookie dough flavor. I don't care about the cost, I'll pay anything for this yummy treat.\n",
            "Hello! Long time scooper, first time writer. The Tonight Dough is a revelation. Many flavours that blend so well together! I especially enjoy the peanut butter dough, it surprises me every time a gob finds its way into a spoonful. Next time I'll try a different flavour... maybe...\n",
            "My favorite Ben & Jerrys ice cream! I love a cookie dough period but this is a cut above just cookie dough. They give you caramel, chocolate chip cookie dough, peanut butter cookie dough and creamy well blended vanilla ice cream. This is crack in a cup and Im here to be drugged\n",
            "Oh my WOOOOOOOORD. BEST. ICECREAM. EVER. Sick? Buy this. Tired? Buy this. Happy? Buy this. Binge watching? Buy this. This Ice cream suits your every need!!! It is the best ice cream. All other companies should really learn from Ben & Jerry's. Would give it 100 stars if I could.\n",
            "I bought this tonight after a long period of contemplation, and I love it! The only thing is, the chocolate cookie swirls that other reviews referenced is the single best ingredient in existence, and I personally thought it should have had more...like a separate pint of it!\n",
            "Love the creaminess and all the toppings in the ice cream. This is my go-to pint to buy at grocery stores. It's loaded with the toppings, doesn't cheap out. The price for this product is decent but is amazing when it's on sale. Delicious and would recommend this to others.\n",
            "Im not supposed to eat dairy, but this is worth it. its delicious ice cream with doughs in it. cold, chewy, rich (but not too rich), creamy, and everything that makes it amazing. I tried this when it first came out years ago and its still my go to. Big fan, its a must try!\n",
            "I have probably tried about every ice cream Ben and jerrys sells in stores and this is the best one. The chunks of cookie dough throughout the ice cream along with the cookie crumble swirl is the best combination. It's so good that it's now the only ice cream I buy ever!!\n",
            "Always Crowd pleaser, what am I saying I never share this ice cream, go hey your own! Creamy, delicious and except ice cream to chocolate chip cookies ratio.\n",
            "I love ice cream with a lot of stuff in it. Ice cream might even be more about texture than flavor for me. If you feel the same way, it really doesnt get better than Ben & Jerrys. The Tonight Dough is my favorite but there are so many delicious Ben & Jerrys ice creams.\n",
            "I absolutely love this ice cream!! It has so many different flavors all in one. I like that it has cookie dough pieces in it. Its kind of on the expensive side but its well worth it. I definitely recommend trying it if you havent and you like all the flavors it has in it.\n",
            "This is my favorite flavor of all the Ben and Jerrys flavors! They put so much cookie dough in them which is the best part since most dont! You can buy it almost anywhere and its not expensive! You gota try it! [product:ben-&-jerrys-chocolate-chip-cookie-dough-ice-cream]\n",
            "5 stars all day long. I ate this Ben and Jerry's flavor every single day while I was pregnant and still continue to love! No other ice cream company fills their flavor with as much goodies like b&j does. Every bite you have cookie dough and brownie swirl. Omg. The best.\n",
            "I love Ben and Jerry and their ice cream. I gave this one a 4 because yes, it's delicious, but it's not my favorite. If I remember correctly, it has two types of cookie dough- chocolate chip and peanut butter. This one will fill my craving when I can't find phish food.\n",
            "Delicious! There is a great chocolate to vanilla ratio. I love the fudge mixed into the chocolate, but not too rich. There are lots of cookie dough bites so you can nearly get one in every other bite. No need to search. Perfectly mixed leaving very little to be desired.\n",
            "This one really might be the best flavor ever. There are SO many chunk pieces and the cookie doughs are the best tasting cookie dough bits compared to any other brand. The caramel and chocolate ice cream is a good pair, and the texture of the cookie swirls are AMAZING.\n",
            "This caramel and chocolate ice cream is truly heavenly! It is not only filled with chocolate swirls, it also contains two different types of cookie dough, peanut butter and chocolate chip! Every bite contains each of these items making for a sweet and delicious treat!\n",
            "The price of Ben and Jerrys has always scared me away, but this ice cream is 16 oz of everything good in the world. It is heaven in a pint. Ben and Jerrys is revolutionary both in social causes and in phenomenal ice cream flavors. Thanks for bringing heaven to Earth.\n",
            "Its been too long since I had this or any Ben & Jerrys ice cream. Their ice cream is just that amazing. Except for cherry, because I do not like fruits in my ice cream, I would probably try all their flavors if I had the chance and money to. Highly highly recommend\n",
            "I'm a huge Ben and Jerry's fan. I really like this flavor, it's not my favorite but still delicious! I don't reach for it every time I'm in the mood for a sweet treat, but sometimes I am just really craving it! I really love the fun, creative collaboration flavors!\n",
            "The dairy free Ben and Jerrys ice cream is the best in my opinion. The texture is and flavor is just like regular ice cream. I think Ben and Jerrys is a bit overpriced but its totally worth it considering that they support great causes and the flavor is immaculate\n",
            "Another great flavour from Ben & Jerry's, the Tonight Dough has an amazing combination of cookie dough, chocolate, peanut butter cups and so much more. I feel guilty when I go into the tub for a 3rd and 4th scoop ... until I eat them and know that is is great.\n",
            "If I want to indulge this is my go to! (Insert mouth water) its so good with the caramel ice cream and cookie dough bits and then you have chocolate Icecream with chunks of peanut butter cookie dough. AND the cookie swirl throughout it all, Seriously sooo good.\n",
            "Love the flavor of this ice cream. It has a great mix of tastes and fix-ins that add a good texture to the ice cream. I always purchase this product when my local Giant Eagle runs a sale on Ben and Jerrys. Otherwise, price can be a little steep for this product.\n",
            "This is one of my girlfriend and my favorite ice creams! We purchase it anytime there is a sale on Ben and Jerry's. Loaded with cookie dough and chocolate this ice cream satisfies any craving. Ben and Jerry's has always been one of my favorite ice cream brands!\n",
            "This is my favorite ice cream! Very chunky-which is a cookie dough lovers dream! The only thing to make it better would be to add more of a fudge component to the ice cream. I also wish that I could find this flavor in the mini-size, rather than just the pint\n",
            "My favorite Ben and Jerrys go to ice cream if Im watching a movie or just need to have a moment. The chunky chocolatey ice cream is what I seek in all of the ice creams I buy and this one is perfect. I like the pb cookies too its a different flavor in the mix.\n",
            "My friends and I often like to take part in taste tests, and this one won out of the 6 brands we tried! Not only is the ice cream itself very creamy and delicious, they have a good amount of chunks and goodies in them. It is expensive but well worth the cost.\n",
            "The tonight dough is my go to for Ben and Jerry. I mean who doesn't love brownie, cookie dough and Jimmy Fallon. Im always down to try a new flavour but usually find myself reaching for this or the half-baked flavour. Can't go wrong with what you know, right?\n",
            "Ben and jerrys ice cream is so good! They have so many wonderful flavors its hard to choose just one. My absolute favorite is the tonight dough. This ice cream never disappoints my taste buds. The only thing is i always finish the whole tub! Its just so good.\n",
            "I’ve had this a few times and it was beyond heavenly but unfortunately the last few times the peanut butter cookie dough has tasted realllllyyy weird and not good. It makes me so sad cause this is the best flavor in the world, or use to be. Please fix it!!!\n",
            "Too much of a chocolate flavor and not enough cookie dough chunks. Not sure if it's freezer burned or an old batch but often the cookie dough chunks will break apart like powder with a terrible taste. Not a bad flavor if cookie dough is like it should be.\n",
            "This. Is. The best. Ice cream I've ever had. It has everything you could want in ice cream. It has vanilla, rich chocolate, caramel, peanut butter, cookie crumbles, and cookie dough. Just simply amazing. I will be buying more of this as soon as I get home.\n",
            "Love this flavor. Its filled with different types of cookie dough and its tastes heavenly. Each spoonful of ice cream will contain a type of cookie dough and ice cream. I would 100% recommend if cookie dough is your favorite part of cookie dough ice cream.\n",
            "The flavor is delicious, the size perfect. Whether it's the \"I just broke up with my boyfriend\" ice cream, or the \"tonight's a special event, here's a treat\" or the \"just because\" ice cream, you cannot go wrong with the Tonight Dough from Ben and Jerry's.\n",
            "When I am craving cookie dough ice cream, this is always the brand I go for. The chunks of Cookie dough are large and worth the money. Its like having an ice cream store in your freezer. I would highly suggest trying this brand if you have an already yet.\n",
            "I’ve had this flavor before and it was so good, I bought it again. This time, the PB dough chunks taste rotten. I’ve seen some similar reviews on this page. I don’t know what happened because I had it before with no issues. Seems like a bad batch??? Yuck.\n",
            "This is hands down my all time favorite ice cream flavor. The dough bites in the ice cream are larger than all other brands and have the perfect level of sweetness. If you are a cookie dough fanatic buy this it will satisfy all your cookie dough cravings\n",
            "They were having a sale at my neighborhood grocery store so I thought I would branch out and pick up a new flavor. After trying this I went back for more!My ultimate favorite ice cream now. You get a bunch of cookie dough it's addicting in a good way lol\n",
            "100000% my absolute favorite ice cream flavor. I absolutely love all of the different flavors in the ice cream and it is full of the different cookie doughs! The texture of the peanut butter dough isnt my favorite, but it doesnt deter from the product\n",
            "i have had this product multiple times and it is always so tasty, however after eating it a lot it can get kind of sickening. also due to cookie dough in it, it can be hard to scoop. but the texture is amazing and i love the flavor of the cookie dough.\n",
            "I'm eating this ice cream as I write this review only because it's amazing and I wish I could share this pint with the world! I HATE chocolate ice cream but decided to give this a try, and let me tell you!! Best decision ever! I'm in ice cream heaven.\n",
            "This is my favorite flavor because it has everything- chocolate, peanut butter, cookies, etc. I love ice cream but its hard for me to choose a flavor so this one is perfect. The small pints are a good size and you can get multiple servings out of it.\n",
            "Ben and Jerrys get 10/10.\n",
            "They hire felons, pay living wage, donate, have been arrested when protesting for the greater good. They may be on the expensive side but when you find out all the good they do it is absolutely worth it.\n",
            "This flavor is good.\n",
            "My favorite Ben and Jerry's flavor to date. All kinds of ice creams and cookie doughs and flavors in this one. Including those awesome cookie crumbles that are always in ice cream cakes. Pretty much everything that is great about ice cream in a pint.\n",
            "One of my favorite B&J flavors. Not only do I love Jimmy Fallon, but this flavor has a great mix of caramel, chocolate ice cream and chocolate chip and peanut butter cookie doughs. DELICIOUS. Its like taking cookie dough ice cream to the next level.\n",
            "The best ice cream ever! I remember craving some sweets one night during my pregnant days. I asked my husband to go pick up some ice cream. It was on sale so he picked one up to try. Omg! Love! We have this in our freezer at all times! So delicious!\n",
            "THIS IS THE BEST!!!!! I love this ice cream with everything in me!! it combines all the best sweets into one and is so creamy but has a fun texture with the brownie and cookie dough. My whole family loves this flavor so it goes quickly in our house.\n",
            "Such a yummy flavor combination and who doesnt love the tonight show!? Ben and Jerrys is the fried and true girls night ice cream and this is my top flavor pick every time! Not to mention, Ben and Jerrys is a B-Corp and advocates for social justice!\n",
            "This is my favorite ice cream of all time! Ben & Jerry's is so creative and has so many great flavors throughout their entire line. Tonight Dough or not, you will not go wrong with choosing any single one of their flavors! I highly recommend this!\n",
            "Their ice cream is good, but have you seen their stance to abolish white supremacy? That is what makes their flavors pop! I will now buy more Ben & Jerrys. This flavor is really good though, all of the sweets you like in one combined flavor! BLM!\n",
            "Immaculate flavor. This company has become well known for their political stance over the last few weeks which has sparked many to go and buy their product. It is delicious and serves its purpose very well!! A tasty, cold treat after a long day!!\n",
            "Hands down the best ice cream. If you love sweets this has it all. A step up from your typical cookie dough ice cream, this one has peanut butter and chocolate chip cookie dough chunks along with even more. Every bite will be filled with cookie.\n",
            "I absolutely love Ben & Jerry's ice cream it is the smoothest creamiest ice cream I have ever tried it is pretty expensive so I wait for it to go on sale but I love love this ice cream and it is loaded with ingredients well worth the indulgence\n",
            "This ice cream is actually my favorite comfort food. Warning it is very sweet and heavy. So if you like plain flavors this is NOT the ice cream for you, but if you live to chocolate this is a must buy! Ben & Jerry's® The Tonight Dough Ice Cream\n",
            "I am a huge ice cream fan I usually dont buy a pint or whatever I usually go out to ice cream shop a little mom and pop shop since thats an option during quarantine I love Ben and Jerrys the only one better than the tonight dough is half baked\n",
            "No matter what flavor I choose Ive never gone wrong with Ben and Jerrys. One of the best ice cream brands, Ill admit its a bit pricy for its small container but its overall worth it. You wouldnt be disappointed with any flavor from this brand.\n",
            "Okay I get it there's a famous person on the package yes of course I bought it. But I was very disappointed it's not as flavorful as it should be considering what favorite Parts he likes in the ice cream. Very disappointing will not buy again\n",
            "I got a few of these at 7 11 thier was almost no cookie dough and the piece I did eat tasted very stale and gross. Not what I was expecting for the price didn't eat the other pint at all so gross and a waste of money also it wasn't expired.\n",
            "This is my absolute favorite Ben & Jerrys ice cream flavor. I love cookie dough and cookies in ice cream, and this has it all and more. So many of my favorite flavors packed into one pint. I never buy any other flavor anymore, only this one.\n",
            "My best friend from high school and I would buy a whole pint of the tonight dough after every choir concert to celebrate one a trimester. We loved how similar it was to half baked but the added peanut butter cookie dough made it even better!\n",
            "All time favorite ice cream!! Perfect cookie dough pieces, chocolate and caramel ice cream make for the richest and most delicious ice cream!! Ben and Jerrys always does the best when it comes to their ice cream and makes it worth the money\n",
            "This one is probably my absolute favorite ice cream all the different tastes and textures in it I love them it goes very well together I was very sad when one of my stores got rid of it because this is like I said my favorite ice cream ever\n",
            "Dangerously delicious. Its my familys favorite flavor by far. Its hard to put down once you pick it up. It has all my favorite flavors and would definitely be my first choice as a dessert. Im a sucker for the cookie dough and brownie in it!\n",
            "Ahhh its sooo good ! It has everything in it ! Chocolate chip cookie dough, peanut butter cookie dough, caramel, and a chocolate cookie swirl . Its cookie dough ice cream but richer in flavor . Its pricey for the size but worth the flavor .\n",
            "This is one of Ben and Jerrys best ice cream flavors, like all Ben and Jerrys ice creams this is loaded with cookie pieces. If you are lucky you can sometimes get these 3 for 6 but if you arent lucky youre stuck spending anywhere from $3-$5\n",
            "This is my favorite flavor of Ben and Jerry's! It has chocolate, it has cookie dough and cookie pieces so what's not to love! I have recommended this ice cream to everyone I know and have even converted some of my friends from other brands.\n",
            "EVERY single Ben and Jerrys ice cream flavor is absolutely amazing Im in love! Its a little on the pricey side but theres always so many ingredients so its definitely a special treat Ben and Jerrys is definitely my favorite ice cream brand!\n",
            "Oh my gosh this is my favorite ice cream!! Its very affordable. It has multiple doughs in it that are delicious!! I love how its not too sweet and too doughy. Every time I go to the store this is the ice cream I grab when I want ice cream.\n",
            "Not my favorite Ben and Jerrys, there is a lot going on with the crunchy cookies and peanut butter. Wouldnt ever be my first choice but hey its still good and I finished it. If I was offered it, I would say yes but I wouldnt buy it again.\n",
            "My fave by Ben and Jerry. Like the different cHunks of dough. I havent bought any in a while. Sometimes I notice my cups were loaded with goodies and other times not so much. Kinda inconsistent, but its been years. I should go buy a pint.\n",
            "I prefer some of their other flavours. Personally I feel like this one has a little too much going on. Also I love Ben and Jerrys but can get more ice cream from other brands for much less, so I can only afford this as a sometimes treat.\n",
            "Super yummy and love Jimmy Fallon, Im just not a huge peanut butter person so it definitely threw me off when trying this. Still super delicious and I would eat it if I was in the mood for it, love the cookie dough and brownies as well!\n",
            "Best grocery store ice cream. The peanut butter cookie dough bites with the brownies makes the perfect combination of sweet and salty. Although the ice cream is very heavy, it is a delicious dessert to have a spoonful of every so often.\n",
            "Ugh so good. The combo of caramel, brownie, and whatever else is in there (can’t remember at the moment) is so great. It’s a little high calorie but so good. I also only buy this on sale because it’s like $6 at rite aid which is insane.\n",
            "One of the few flavors at the 7/11 across the street from me, so Ive had this one a few times when Im craving ice cream late at night. All textures and flavors I enjoy in this one, so I dont mind that its one of the only options I have.\n",
            "This pint is one of my favorites! All the mix-ins I could want. I always find the ice cream base of Ben & Jerrys to be perfectly creamy too! It is a bit pricy so I try to find it on sale or 2-for-1! If youve not tried it, pick one up!\n",
            "This is my favorite ice cream. Nothing else to say. It's hot perfect chunks of choclate and peanutbutter it is my guilty pleasure. Although ben and Jerry's can get super expensive, sometimes I treat myself to this wonderful creation.\n",
            "This ice cream literally makes me weak because its so good haha! The tonight dough is the best flavor of ice cream ever created, and it is impossible to not eat the whole thing in one sitting! Absolutely delicious and would recommend\n",
            "This ice cream is HEAVEN. SOOO good with chocolate chip cookie dough and peanut butter cup together its a great mixture of both. Good balance. Im not one for an overly heavy kinda chocolate ice cream but this one is a good treat.\n",
            "I’ve had this flavor a few times and usually love it.. this last pint was alarmingly devoid of cookie dough. There were 3 huge chunks of cookie dough, the rest was just plain chocolate ice cream. I don’t know exactly what happened\n",
            "I love this ice cream. The cookie dough is so good and the ice cream has the perfect texture. Its nice that is has a combination of flavours of ice cream and cookie dough. It’s a little pricey, but it’s definitely worth the money.\n",
            "Tried this ice cream for the first time a few days ago and it didnt disappoint. I loved the peanut butter and cookie dough mix. The caramel and chocolate ice cream didnt give it an overwhelming sweetness to it. Must try ice cream!\n",
            "This I've cream is perfect for people who like a lot of \"stuff\" in their ice cream. It honestly had a great Balance of stuff to ice cream. I love that it has everything in it... Great when you can't decide what you exactly want.\n",
            "This product is a chocolate cookie dough lover dream. The amount of cookie dough in this product is phenomenal. Its my main go to when I am craving raw cookie dough. Its definitely a product I would recommend and would buy again.\n",
            "This is my favorite flavor from Ben & Jerrys. Everytime I get a different flavor, I realize it just doesnt add up to this flavor and I always go back and get this one. It has everything you want thats sweet in one pint! So good!\n",
            "Ben and Jerrys is my absolute go to ice cream. In my opinion it is worth the price tag on it. I really really wish they made bigger sizes though. All flavors are amazing I would definitely recommend there ice cream to everyone.\n",
            "This flavor is sooo delicious! It has a little bit of all the doughs/cookies and brownies that everyone loves. The caramel and chocolate ice creams combine very well with all the flavors of doughs and make for one tasty treat.\n",
            "Every single Friday me and my boyfriend each get a pint of this amazing ice cream. This is by far the only Ice cream I eat and I will drive to 4-5 different stores just to find this flavor. 10/10 would recommend it is amazing.\n",
            "This is my absolute favorite ice cream ever. I love love love Ben and Jerrys and this flavor is soooooo good!!! May be a little expensive for just a pint but still the flavor makes up for the price. 11/10 rating if possible :)\n",
            "My husband turned me onto this flavor and it is super good. Its very expensive for a small bit though so we definitely dont buy often. I found that HEB has a flavor very similar so we constantly buy that one instead for price\n",
            "I'm not a huge ice cream person. I don't really buy it on my own - just eat it when offered from other folks. However, after my friend gave me a taste of this, I've been searching for it ever since!\n",
            "Overall the flavor is good. You just have to avoid looking at the label when eating it, otherwise seeing that smug face might make you queasy.\n",
            "This was pretty good! It has all the flavors I love in ice cream. It was rich but also so satisfying. Anyone who is a fan of chocolate and baked goods in your ice cream are certainly going to love this just as much as I did!\n",
            "This is my favorite Ben & Jerrys. I only get it when Im splurging as the price is very high, and I can get a whole gallon from most other brands for this price. But the flavors of this one are good and they are very balanced\n",
            "This is one of my favorite ice cream flavors! It is packed with chocolate chip and peanut butter cookie dough, chocolate cookie crumbles mixed into chocolate and caramel ice cream. Everything you could want in an ice cream!\n",
            "This is my favorite Ben & Jerrys ice cream EVER; plus Jimmy Fallon makes me giggle. It has all my favorites, cookie dough, chocolate fudge chunks (similar to the Dairy Queen ice cream cake filling), and peanut butter balls!\n",
            "My all time favorite flavor. Ben & Jerrys has been around a long time. I think the Price is similar to other pint sized ice cream packages. And this one is responsibly produced. Delicious and socially responsible. Win Win\n",
            "This is my favorite flavor of the Ben & Jerrys ice cream. I love cookie dough and the pieces are a pretty good size as well. It is rather pricey but in this case its absolutely worth it. Every chance I get I treat myself.\n",

            "One of my favorite go to ice creams to eat! I love eating thing with some wine or on a date night as I dont eat ice cream too often but when I do, I get the tonight dough flavor! So good! I binge eat this once I open it!\n",
            "My fav Ben and Jerrys flavor. Im not a huge ice cream fan but i do love this flavor. It is really sweet so Im only able to have like 4 bites at a time which is really random but hey i did say Im not a huge ice cream fan.\n",
            "This has everything you need in a great ice cream flavor. It's like i went to an ice cream shop and had them make something special for me. I've never had a better flavor! I would add a pic, but it's all gone. So yum!\n",
            "By far my favorite flavor ice cream. However, I could do without the peanut butter flavor. Nonetheless this packaging and concept is literally everything and I tell everyone to get this anytime they have an opportunity.\n",
            "By far the best ice cream I have ever tasted! The mix in this ice cream is perfection and you can’t get enough of it! It’s expensive, but when it’s on sale it worth every penny! You won’t want any other ice cream again.\n",
            "I would die for this ice cream! Although it is on the more expensive side, it is worth it. It is rich in flavor and creamy, added with amazing snacks such as cookie dough. I would buy this ice cream over and over again.\n",
            "Honestly. I hope this never goes away. It's amazing! I love the many different flavors and gobs of cookie dough and the cookie swirl and everything else. It's like the ultimate ice cream flavor. Definitely my favorite.\n",
            "Not bad. I dont see it too many places. But its something that I would get like once in a blue moon isnt something Im crazy about. And there are better ice creams out there and I would only buy it if I had nothing else\n",
            "This one is ok. Nothing for me to write home about. But as an avid Ben and Jerrys lover, I felt this one to be a bit lacking. Still tasty which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of less. I still love you Ben and Jerry!\n",
            "The tonight dough is to die for! If you love ice cream and chocolate this is your pint. I would post pictures if I would of resisted eating it in time. Alittle more pricier than others but worth the extra investment!\n",
            "This is my FAVORITE ice cream in the world. So many insane flavors and dough inside. I try not to buy to often but when Im feeling down or its that time of the month that whole thing is downed in 10 minutes . Love!\n",

            "If I could rate this 20 stars I would. THIS IS LIFE CHANGING FLAVOR! The cookie bits? Chewy, decadent, wow factor. The swirls? Rich, sugary goodness. The ice cream? Picturesque Jay Gatsby-esque luciousness.\n",
            "I have purchased this a couple of times. It captures a mix of ingredients that just make the perfect combination which is really hard to describe. My only complaint is that the cookie dough is really big.\n",

            "Not enough cookie dough. Overall, it tastes okay..\n",
            "Please keep this flavor forever i love it so much!\n",
            "So, I want to start off by saying my addiction to this started on my birthday 2 years ago, I was like \" OH! I'll try this it sounds good.\" And the rest was history. This ice cream has got to be my all time favorite over all other ice creams ever, from marble creamers to mom and pop stores, large brands to small brands. ALL TIME FAVORITE! I've always been the kind of girl that's more like 'Ice Cream in my toppings,' not toppings in my ice cream. This totally hits the spot! It's like Vanilla/Chocolate ice cream with \"chocolate cookie\" ribbon like swirls, and chunks of both chocolate chip cookie dough and PB cookie dough. IT IS AMAZING, so amazing that when my local grocer puts it on sale by even 0.25 its sold out before any other flavor.\n",
            "As to some of the reviews saying the favor changed, I think its more the retailer your buying it from. I don't get mine from Target any more b/c they let the ice cream melt a bit before they can get it stored again. I'm pretty sure that ruins it a bit b/c it mushes the flavors all up and makes things wonkie. That's probably what happened to some of you all. When i got a few like that over a couple of months the PB tasted off, not bad, just off. Kinda like switch from JIF to Skippie or whatever they are called. Either way, I'd say try this flavor if you like Ice cream with your toppings, and are a fan of cookie dough in general.\n",
            "this ice cream singlehandedly provides me with 3 days worth of seratonin. every bite is pure joy, ecstasy, and transcends all human taste possibility. let’s get real here ladies THREE TYPES OF COOKIE DOUGH!!! and it’s not like most cookie dough ice cream where you’re eating for a while and go, “where’s the cookie dough??” NO!!! THERE IS COOKIE DOUGH IN EVERY BITE BRUH!!! the distribution of the cookie dough within the ice cream is my favorite part however, the ice cream itself is beautiful. because it’s not all chocolate it makes me feel a little better about stuffing it into my esophagus. The Tonight Dough is NOT just an ice cream it is a way of LIFE!!! in fact i have spent TWO YEARS searching for an ice cream that gives me the same RUSH as a spoonful of this heaven, alas none quite do the trick. If i had a chance to time travel i would travel back and give whomever came up with this concept for ice cream a BIG OLE SMOOCH!!! they truly outdid themselves. i no longer buy any any ANY other ice cream at stores because this is the ONLY ice cream worth eating. A song once said “I scream, you scream, we ALL scream for ice cream”. i will personally guarantee you NO SCREAM can match the pure HAPPINESS that RUSHES through my veins when i open the freezer and see jimmy fallon there. NOT because i love jimmy fallon but because of the pure adrenaline coursing through me at the thought of the cookie dough confection that is the TONIGHT DOUGHHH!!!! i now have a pavlovian response you mr fallon’s face. It causes me to salivate profusely. In all seriousness THIS IS THE BEST THING YOU WILL EVER EAT. I LOVE YOU BEN I LOVE YOU JERRY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PURE HAPPINESS!!!!! <3\n",
            "I love the surprise in every bite! Caramel and chocolate are a marriage made in heaven!! The caramel ribbons and the caramel covered chocolate bites are sinful! This is by far my all time favorite ice cream!! I drive past 5 grocery stores that carry other Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream just to go purchase this particular flavor!\n",
            "I bought this the other night thinking there were no good flavors, and let me tell you. BEST decision of my life. I will NEVER go back. Thank you to the wonder minds who created this flavor and the hard working people who made and packaged my pint. Last but not least the kind soul who was generous enough to deliver my pint to the store I bought i from.\n",
            "This hands down is the most delicious caramel ice cream. The caramel ice cream, caramel cups & the caramel swirl are perfection. Amazing\n",
            "If you love caramel, there will NEVER be another ice cream flavor for you!!! What can I say besides its amazing, I love it and can never get enough of it...\n",
            "Oh boy, this flavor is the trifecta. I love it so much it's going to be the end of a waistline. Thank you B&J's!!!\n",
            "So I just polished off my first Triple Caramel Chunk and I’m very happily stuffed! The caramel ice cream, the swirl and the chocolate fudge chunks; all awesome and perfectly balanced. There is just something so enticing about pulling off the lid of a B&J pint to reveal that glassy smooth ice cream underneath, just begging to be spooned.\n",
            "This is just plain ol’ fashioned good! I love it! The caramel ice cream: great. The caramel swirl: delicious. The caramel-filled truffles: silly yummy! If you need lots of caramel flavor with several different textures (and some nice chocolate, too) as I often do, then this is the ice cream for you! It’ll put a nice big smile right on that mug of yours, and when was the last time you turned down a little extra happiness?\n",
            "I would expect a flavor called \"Triple Caramel Chunk\" to have more of a pronounced caramel flavor. The chunks were few and far between and the caramel swirl was pretty much absent. I wanted something that looks like the picture used in your glamor shots, but got something a lot closer to plain light-brown ice cream with a vague caramel0sh taste. Nothing at all like it's advertised to be.\n",
            "I purchased this ice cream thinking it might tast great , reading the title, but i was very dispappointed by it!! The ice cream did not taste like caramel , infact it was tasteless. I will never purchase from ben and jerry again,coz there description does not actually match with the flavor.\n",
            "First off, the ice cream tasted great. The problem is with the quantity of the chunks. In the pint I bought there were 4 chunks and i expected much more since many of the other great Ben and Jerry ice creams are loaded with treats. Plus I like the contrast between the ice cream and candy treats\n",
            "I was very excited to try this flavor of ice cream, however I was saddened that the ice cream wasn't rich and creamy like Ben & Jerry's usually is. The flavor was there, but it had a gritty texture. I tried to power through but after 1/4 of the pint I gave up, I couldn't get past the texture. :(\n",
            "This was actually my first ice cream I tasted by Ben & Jerry's years ago and I fell in love with it! It had gotten discontinues for a short while I think I wrote to bring it back a few times lol BUT I LOVE IT! I have about 3 pints sitting in my freezer! Great job with this one!\n",
            "I read the review by Sara H. I recommend that she and others spoon a moderate amount of caramel from the center and with the balance of the spoon capacity, scoop a significant amount of vanilla, then allow those proportions to melt in your mouth and prepare for ecstasy.\n",
            "My boyfriend loves this flavor so much, if he's ever grumpy, it just puts a huuuuuge smile on his face.\n",
            "I wish I could find this one easier in Maryland now that I'm hooked on it.\n",
            "Never saw many of these at any of the stores I visit\n",
            "I recently found this at my local grocer and was a little skeptical since I like bourbon (I'm from KY so by law I have to) but I'm not a big fan of caramel. I decided to give it a try but still bought my go-to flavor, Chunky Monkey, just in case this bourbon and caramel infused ice cream wasn't my cup of tea. Despite my reservations I instantly fell in love with this ice cream and now keep a pint stocked in my freezer at all times. the caramel bourbon flavor is smooth, not to rich, and the almonds pieces pair well with the flavor and chunks of chocolate. Well done Ben & Jerry. I reall hope this flavor stays in the lineup for a long while.\n",
            "It is SO good! I've been trying out new flavors instead of my stand by of chunky monkey or mint chocolate cookie. I have liked most and loved 3. But this one knocks my number one out! im not usually a Carmel fan especially the gooey kind (i usually go fudge) but wow! The only thing that I would have done differently is the nuts, i think pecans would have been in keeping with the southern theme ihis has going. But yes, I know, there is aways the pecan pie, which was just a like in my book.\n",
            "On a particularly lonely Sunday while I was shopping I decided to grab my normal flavor \"Everything But The...\" to give myself a little treat. Then I saw this flavor staring at me. Carmel, Almonds, and Bourbon oh my! SOLD! I hurried thru dinner so I could rip open the container to get my first spoonful. Its creamy burnt carmel taste hit me first and I couldn't stop. The almonds and chocolate made for great trio of flavor but then it happened... I hit the bourbon carmel center. Oh my goodness my mouth waters just thinking of it. I promptly took a pic and sent it to several friends telling them to find some for themselves right away. Thank you B&J for yet another addiction.\n",
            "Yet another amazing flavor to come out of the Ben & Jerry's flavor laboratory. I had to hide it from the wife so she wouldn't eat mine.\n",
            "I normally love B&J, even if I don't love a flavor I try, I can still appreciate it. But not this time. First of all, the almonds are like flavorless splinters. The bourbon swirl tastes like bananas. And generally I like ice cream with chunks in it, but this was so overrun you can't even enjoy the ice cream. I'm whining about it because B&J might want to count the votes when deciding whether to keep making this flavor. I'm sure lots of people will try it, but I doubt you'll get a lot of repeat customers. But thanks for making such awesome ice cream (aside from this) and by the way my boyfriend LOVES your chocolate cherry Garcia. I do to. Hope you'll keep making it!\n",
            "This flavor is simply not your ordinary ice cream. I enjoy a good helping of Boom Chocolatta Cookie Core now and then, but sometimes I just don't feel like something super sweet and chocolate-y. This flavor has a little bit of everything. Chunks: check. Sweetness: check. Saltiness: check. Rich, dark undertones of something mysterious: check. I love the balance of the darker, rich flavors with the salty, sweet flavors. This is the BEST! All I can say is, they better not ever get rid of it! It's addicting!\n",
            "I was a little worried about buying a new flavor because I have bought a few lately that I haven't liked and I didn't want to be let down again. But my favorite flavor is no longer available so I took a risk on this one and boy am I glad. I can't put my spoon down! The almonds, fudge flakes and caramel swirl dance in your mouth and while sometimes you get a bit of the bourbon taste it is not overpowering! Great work guys!!\n",
            "So happy my husband got this for me to try! He knows I love bourbon. I really love this flavor! I think u did it just right! Don't think I will share this pint. Maybe the next one. Which there will b plenty of because this is hands down my new favorite!!!! I am not a huge fan of caramel either so I was a little skeptical. But this is the perfect blend of the caramel and the almonds and the chocolate and the bourbon flavor all together. Yummmmmmmmm Nice job <3\n",
            "I bought this yesterday thinking I would try a 'new' flavor for Sunday dessert. I returned it today minus the spoon or two letting me know this is not a flavor for me. The first spoon was so overrun with almond 'bits' that I could not get a good taste of the ice cream. The second spoon did not prove any better. Needless to say I did not make it to the 'swirl' before deciding it had to be returned.\n",
            "This was the first time I shook my head in wonder at a B&J product (wondering who came up with this; how did it make it to market as a B&J product).\n",
            "I love Ben & Jerry's, and I've never been disappointed by a flavor until now. The burnt caramel is pretty unpleasant and the bourbon is definitely lacking. The almonds killed it for me though. After each bite the ice cream was long gone and I was still chewing up an unnecessary amount of almonds. After about six spoonfuls I couldn't take it anymore and had to scoop myself some store-brand vanilla to get the taste out of my mouth. Sorry Ben & Jerry, I love you guys but this flavor is not for me. I'll stick to my Phish food.\n",
            "I was bugging my mom about how much I wanted Ben & Jerry's so when my mom took me to the store I was staring at the frozen doors drooling and I was looking at all the flavors and my usual \"half baked\" wasn't there so I grabbed Urban bourbon because it sounded delicious!! I went home and started eating it and it didn't have any flavor, all it tasted like was coldness overwhelmed by the tiny almond shreds. The only pleaseant part about this ice cream was the Carmel swirls. I wish I bought the bob Marley ice cream !! But I still love Ben & Jerry's no hate\n",
            "My stepmom first introduced me to this flavor of Ice cream, and after my first taste I fell in love. I’ve been buying this flavor for about a year I think now and it never gets old! Recently I’ve heard some rumors saying that the Urban Bourbon flavor is going to be discontinued? Since I’ve heard that, I’ve been buying 3-4 tubs of it every time I go to the grocery store. I know there are thousands and maybe even millions of reviews out there, but if you happen to stumble across mine I would like to ask...could you could possibly keep Urban Bourbon as a permanent flavor? Thank you Ben and Jerry!\n",
            "I think Ben and Jerry ice cream is a superior ice cream to most. When I saw urban bourbon I was really excited to combine 2 of my favorite things. I tried 2 pints, and neither had much of a bourbon flavor to them. The little bits of bourbon that I did get were very good, would have been nice to have more of it\n",
            "I would have hoped for the price of a pint, the flavor would have better matched the name, feel a little taken.\n",
            "I instantly got addicted to this new flavor. I've been sad about Dublin Mudslide going to the graveyard for years, but I may have just found something at least equally good. Yes, it's sweet (caramel swirls), but not as sweet as any of the 'core' pints or Phish food that I do not like at all. Urban Bourbon is such a delicious combination of flavors! With the crunchy almonds, and chocolat bits it is really perfect to me. Chillin' the Roast and New York Super Fudge (one of my go-to's) seemed bland after Urban Bourbon.\n",
            "The ice cream is what counts - all the extras thrown in aren't going to compensate for ice cream with no flavor. This ice cream has a complex, full bodied, intense caramel/bourbon taste and is loaded with flavor notes. The thick dark chocolate flakes and almond bits accent the flavor. This was excellent - so much better than the grainy flavorless taste of the coconuts for caramel flavor. I love it.\n",
            "The flavor sounds great in theory but it seems like it's a challenge to make consistent flavoring and distribution of ingredients. My point contained too much of a large center swirl of bourbon that was overly sweet and had me gagging. I couldn't even enjoy the perimeter and ended up tossing the entire pint before guzzling almost a liter of water! Definitely has kinks that need to be worked out.\n",
            "I love the flavor and texture but was a littke annoyed when i did some research and found there wasn't any real alcohol in it even though it lists whisky as one of the ingridients. Was hoping to at least get a little buzz but was disapointed. Thought it was ice cream for grown ups but i guess not.\n",
            "I haven't eaten ice cream in months-trying to get into a health kick-but I saw this and didn't think twice before grabbing it up to by it guilt free. I am obsessed with bourbon-one of the only liquors worth drinking-so seeing an ice cream with it made my day.\n",
            "If you make it into a milkshake you get more of the bourbon flavor even distributed!\n",
            "Totally need to buy more!\n",
            "New favorite.\n",
            "If it goes, I go too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
            "This has all the flavors and textures I love do when I tried it, it was perfection! Unfortunately, I can no longer find it in grocery stores :(\n",
            "I found this flavor a few years ago and have loved it ever since! Unfortunately it is EXTREMELY hard to find in stores.\n",
            "So far so good, but I just wanted to know if it had alcohol in it? My son wants to try it lol\n",
            "The store was out of Chunky Monkey, but when I saw this I had to try it. I never expected it would be my new favorite. I have actually doubled my ice cream consumption because of it.\n",
            "Ever since Heathbar was removed from your ingredients, I have been searching for a new favorite icecream. The replacement toffee just wasn't the same. Well I can say that I am glad I remained loyal because this is my new favorite icecream. This could definitely be the difference for me :)\n",
            "despite the name there is no \"alcoholy\" flavors. the base ice cream is delicate, the fudge chunks are rich in flavor as always, I wish there was a bit more almonds in it though as you don't get nuts in every bite and I LOVE almonds but the creamy caramel swirl smoothed me over. delicious!\n",
            "I purchased this a few days ago and now I'm hooked! This is my FAVORITE ice cream! I used to go to Bruster's a lot to buy ice cream but this one puts everything they have to shame! Thanks so much for this wonderful new flavor and I hope you keep this one on the market!!! :)\n",
            "Let me begin by saying that I am a serious B&J fan, lately consuming whole pints in a day. Unfortunately, as far as this flavor is concerned, epileptics like me don’t dare try it because of the whiskey (even in tiny amounts, alcohol is a very potent seizure trigger). A recovering alcoholic friend of mine said the same thing, that it could trigger a craving that could undo all his work. Delicious ice cream is not a good reason to spend a night in the hospital. Assurances from B&J isn’t enough, folks, how about an alcohol-free version? (I don’t even like bourbon very much, but a gin-flavor will probably do me in, LOL.)\n",
            "I am loving the new flavors. By far this ia my favorite. im not big on chocolate in my ice cream so i was skeptical on this flavor. To my surprise its perfect! Tiny little flakes and perfect amount of almonds. The bourbon taste is spot on not to overwhelming but noticable.\n",
            "Just found this in the freezer at my in-laws' and I gave it a try. Usually caramel is so sweet in ice cream but this was unlike anything I've had before. The balance of flavor was perfect. The chocolate flakes and almonds were plentiful in every bite. Highly recommended!\n",
            "This stuff is amazingly good. And addictive. I chose this new flavor on a whim, not to my boyfriends liking. He is now addicted. I agree, it's probably a new favorite. But he can't stop eating it... Great blend of flavors. Whoever came up with this needs an award.\n",
            "My absolute favorite. My local stores aren't selling this anymore! I'm so sad.\n",
            "I don't understand some of the not so great reviews...I'm not even a fan of ice cream without a lot of chocolate in it...but this...wow...What an awesome difference from something totally chocolate.\n",
            "Go for it. Can't miss with this. YUM.\n",
            "I tried this flavor when it arrived on the shelves at my grocery store. I am HOOKED!! The amount of almonds and chocolate chunks pairs exactly with the burnt caramel and bourbon. I can't imagine a more perfect icecream!!!!\n",
            "Can't get enough! Love it. The burnt caramel base flavor is awesome, almonds and fudge the perfect mix ins, but the whiskey flavor is the straw that stirs the drink. Awesome\n",
            "I bought this flavor on a whim one time when stocking up on my most recent favorite the Tonight Dough. I was shocked, the burnt caramel flavor mixed with chocolate and bourbon flavors was an instant hit the minute it hit my taste buds. I am normally a chocolate ice cream kind of gal through and through. But this was sooo good and different from anything I had ever had and it still cured that sweet tooth of mine. I've already bought this several more times and introduced it to so many friends who love it as well! In this case change is a good thing!!\n",
            "While I still mourn the passing of Tennessee Mud long ago my new boozy ice cream headache fix is Urban Bourbon. It's a fun mix of sweet, burnt and boozy!\n",
            "I was so excited to try this and i love it. Probably because it Has all my favorite things in it- nuts, caramel, bourbon. Mmm :)\n",
            "I had this one once and didn’t like it, but I wanted to give it another chance and bought it again, and I’m glad I did. It’s really actually quite good when it gets a little melty. The ice cream flavor itself is somewhat subtle and the fudge chunks are really great. The bourbon caramel swirl is delicious! I will definitely buy this flavor again.\n",
            "Just ate this for breakfast. Great way to start the day. Not being sarcastic\n",
            "LOVE this flavor. Ben & Jerry's knocked it out of the ballpark. I picked this up at the grocery store because it's new and I like caramel. When I got home I attempted to take a taste of it and ended up eating half the pint! I love the unique bourbon and caramel flavors and the crunch of the chocolate and almonds.\n",
            "If I could give zero stars, I would. I love Bourbon but this ice cream was gross. I got barely a quarter of a pint done and had to throw it out. Luckily I went out the next night and found gen and jerry's One Love and that made up for it.\n",
            "After trying this ice cream nothing can compare..no other flavors, not gelato, nothing!! I cannot eat just a scoop. Once I start eating it the next thing you know I'm at the bottom of the container. Only thing that would make this better is a larger size container!!\n",
            "The last two times I went in my Kroger the shelf was empty..no Urban Bourbon! Today when I went they had a sign saying it was on closeout. I bought all 8 containers they had. Please Ben & Jerry's don't send this flavor to the graveyard!!!\n",
            "I wanted to love this flavor. EVERYTHING in the ingredients were things that I liked individually. Except... the 'burnt caramel ice cream'. All I can taste is that burnt flavor, sadly, and it overwhelms everything else. I understand wanting to try a combination that isn't so sweet in every aspect... but sadly, the burnt aspect of it drowns out the other elements to the point I can't taste anything else in much the same respect that several of their coffee flavored iced creams do for me. A shame.\n",
            "I bought this for my husband who loves anything bourbon flavored. He couldn't wait to try it and was very disappointed. He said it had no flavor at all that he could tell, it was just overly sweet. There was certainly no flavor of bourbon.\n",
            "I just bought this tonight and am happily surprised. I have been going from flavor to flavor and brand to brand looking for just the right chunky and carmelly combo. And the bourbon is the cherry on top! Thank you for making the best out there.\n",
            "It's fine, but it didn't wow me. The flavors are all just too muted, for some reason. But, it was 90 degrees in the city today, so I'm not too unhappy about it. I'm just glad I have ice cream to cool me down.\n",
            "This has everything I look for in an ice cream, but more! I've never had this flavor of ice cream. My only complaint is, I actually think it has too many almonds! But that's better than having too few!\n",
            "This ice cream is ok. I think if it was made with salted caramel and a few less almonds it would be great. The bourbon swirls are tasty. I was a little disappointed in this flavor.\n",
            "At about the second bite, on top of the extreme sweetness, there's a strong overly \"toasty\" taste. I felt that they overplayed the burnt caramel. At least there's soft notes of nuttiness at the end.\n",
            "This one is a keeper, so good. The bourbon and the caramel go together so well. Almonds come through too. Chocolate chunks should be smaller.\n",
            "I love ben and jerry's however i was not a fan on this. I didnt taste much bourbon and did not enjoy the \"burnt caramel\"\n",
            "I wanted to like this one but it is missing something.\n",
            "This is my absolute favorite Ben and Jerry's flavor. I'm worried with some of the negative reviews that this flavor might get pulled, but please don't! I don't really understand some of the other reviews that are basically calling for this to be pulled from the shelves because some of the flavors are more unique. Everyone has different tastes, and I'm sure they would be perfectly satisfied with something like triple caramel chunk, why does that mean urban bourbon has to go? Part of the reason I love Ben and Jerry's is because they have more creative flavors than the typical chocolate, vanilla, caramel etc. you find with other brands. There's nothing wrong with liking basic caramel and cookie dough flavors, they're a classic for a reason, but I don't understand why everything on the market has to fit into that cookie cutter mold.\n",
            "Omit the almonds and this would be a 4.5! The almonds are tiny and get in the way. The hinder the flavor. I like when ice cream is smooth going down. Now it feels grainy. The flavor otherwise is good and the bourbon caramel is amazing. The chocolate is slightly too dry. I think they need to use the phish food fudge recipe instead.\n",
            "Bought a pint 3 days ago, love the flavors, but the almonds are too finely chopped for me, they get stuck in the corners of the mouth & in between teeth. I found myself focusing on trying to avoid the annoying almond pieces (impossible) instead of really enjoying the great taste of the ice cream, fudge, & bourbon Carmel swirl.\n",
            "My wife brought this home. She drinks bourbon, I do not. This is by FAR our favorite flavor ice cream! Even though I don't drink, you can really taste the bourbon in the caramel. But it's not a bitter alcohol taste. And the dark chocolate chips are the perfect sweet/bitter combination to compliment the burnt caramel and bourbon. Not too overly sweet like most ice cream. I really hope this flavor is around for a really long time!\n",
            "I usually love Ben & Jerrys but I was disappointed with this one. Everything in the ice cream including the bourbon flavor had actually sank to the bottom of the container. So 95% of it was basically pretty blah tasting and the other 5% was overwhelming, which of course you couldn't eat.\n",
            "I was standing in front of the refrigerator debating over what flavor ice cream to get when Urban Bourbon caught my eye. I love alcohol flavored sweets and warned the family that they might have to get their own pint. \"It has caramel\" they said \"You don't like caramel\" but it's Ben & Jerry's I replied. They didn't listen and now they wish they had because this perfectly blended flavor frenzy is only mine!\n",
            "So my first taste of Ben & Jerry's was Urban Bourbon ice cream. I ate the whole thing in one sitting! I have tried to say away from it because it is soooo good and I have no will power to put it down. Luckily for me the stores around me have stopped carrying this flavor but, I still look for it when I am out shopping. I know if I happen to come across it again it will be coming home with me.\n",
            "my coworker has been raving about this ice cream for a while now and she really described the flavor well enough to make me want to try it so i did...and it was awesome! loved how many and how big the chocolate chunks are and the flavor of that ice cream to match the caramel. and the nuts are a nice texture combined with it all. awesome new flavor, will definitely be buying more in the future\n",
            "Just tried your new flavor, it's just okay, not my cup of tea. I didn't get any bourbon flavor at all, would have been better with roasted almonds, way too many fudge \"chunks\". Still a B&J fan though!\n",
            "My husband bought this flavor and made the mistake of leaving it unattended for a few days. I honestly didn't have high hopes based on the flavor description, but then I tried it and wow! Definitely my new favorite flavor! I thought all of the elements worked really well together and felt that the \"burnt \" caramel flavor wasn't overwhelming like I had initially feared. Great work!\n",
            "This is absolutely my favourite Ben and Jerry’s flavour...I can’t tell you how mn\\any pints of this I’ve packed away in the past two years! It’s not overly sweet but the flecks of almond and perfect crunch to the dark chocolate. I’m addicted to the caramel swirl... I’m telling you as a Ben and Jerry’s fan - YOU MUST TRY THIS FLAVOUR okay I’m off to buy some more okay thanks bye\n",
            "We absolutely love this new ice cream-and hope you guys will keep Urban Bourbon as a permanent flavor! Its the best caramel ice cream out there and we can't get enough of it!\n",
            "I was really when I saw this flavor. I was debating between Phish Food and this one. I have had Phish Food before, so I gave this one a try. There seemed to be a lack of flavor and it didn't really have an ice cream taste to it. It was not horrible, I was just nor impressed with it. I usually like the new flavors that Ben & Jerry's release, but this one just did not cut it.\n",
            "Urban Bourbon is my new favorite. The flavors just melt together in a happy little dance in your mouth. It was all gone before I knew it!!YUM YUM YUM!!!!\n",
            "I thought I was going to love this. Unfortunately my stomach did not agree. I was up overnight & the next day spending a lot of time in the bathroom. That was only a half pint. When I finished it a few days later, same thing happened. Ha, ha. I learned my lesson.\n",
            "I have eaten many of your other flavors without an issue. But Urban Bourbon, i'll steer clear of.\n",
            "Not a perfect replacement for my old favorite, Bonnaroo Buzz. But it's still great. In reality this is a 4.5 stars for me, but that's not an option. The reason: not enough Bourbon flavor. It's there, but you really have to try to find it. That really is the only downside for me. All things considered, this is a nice blend and I hope it stays around a while.\n",
            "I am not an avid caramel consumer, but this product has converted me, at least for ice cream. There is something magical about the combination of flavors here. I am a huge fan of New York Super Fudge Chunk flavor and can't find that any longer. This one is my new go-to flavor at any point. My second is tongue twister Truffle Kerfuffle.\n",
            "Did not have the flavor intensity I expected. Quite frankly, it was boring.\n",
            "I found this flavor several months ago and I absolutely love it!!! But, I just noticed that the grocery store in my area has it on closeout....:( I am so obsessed with it that I bought the last 5 cartons that they have so I could enjoy for a couple more weeks!! Hope you aren't stopping the production of this flavor!!!\n",
            "I did not love this flavor but it’s not because of a defective pint. I just personally didn’t care for it but I can see why other people would love it. It sounded perfect to me but for some reason, it just did t do it for me. But hey, everyone has their tastes and I can understand why people love this one. Just not me.\n",
            "I was really looking forward to this flavor. I am a huge fan of Ben and Jerry's and a huge fan of bourbon, so it seemed like a dream come true. Unfortunately it was not at all what I'd hoped. It was so different than I expected that I actually bought a second one just to make sure; alas, both were the same. First off the ice cream didn't have that caramel taste one associates with bourbon; to me it tasted like coffee ice cream. It wasn't bad tasting, it just wasn't bourbon flavored. Also there were a LOT of chopped almonds in it, so many that it completely dominates the taste and texture of the ice cream. It seemed as though half the volume of the carton consisted of almonds. Now if they had labeled this \"Almond Ice Cream with mild coffee flavor\", at least I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up. Again, it's not bad (if you like nuts in your ice cream, which I don't), but it's not bourbon either. There are lots of Ben and Jerry's flavors I crave; this is not going to be one of them.\n",
            "I bought this because it sounded weird enough to be good and it was way better than good. It is nutty, sweet, slightly burnt but not overwhelmingly so, the chunks and swirls were perfectly balanced with each other and the ice cream. 12/10. I will cry myself to sleep id it should ever be pulled from shelves.\n",
            "Not too sweet; not too burnt; not too bourbony—but enough of all of the above to taste decadent. Having happened upon it elsewhere and immediately fallen in love, I requested this in my local grocery store, and I'm happy to say that it;'s been selling like hotcakes, so I think they'll keep ordering it.\n",
            "Just bought it today. Tried a spoonful and was skeptical it wasn't going to really taste like Bourbon. I was proved wrong. It's deliciously sinful. I do wish you could omit the almonds and add more bourbon. Well done!! Maybe B n J should try something with Bailey's or a Tequila Margarita ice :)\n",
            "This is probably my favorite flavor from Ben & Jerry's. I've pretty sure I've single-handedly bought all the Urban Bourbon from my local grocery store.\n",
            "The nutty flavor paired with the bits of nuts and chocolate just absolutely makes my day at the end of a work day.\n",
            "MORE LIKE THIS PLEASE.\n",
            "I'm in love with the burnt caramel ice cream in this flavor! The bourbon caramel swirls, chocolate chunks, and almond pieces put it over the top. The ice cream is complex and sophisticated. Probably not for kids. ; ) It was all I could do not to eat the whole pint in one sitting!\n",
            "I have been looking for a replacement for my dearly departed Oatmeal Cookie Chunk and then out of the blue came Urban Bourbon! It is a wonderfully complex and not too sweet pint of delight. On the down side, now I can't find it any more either. Is B&J trying to make me crazy?\n",
            "This might be my new favorite Ben and Jerry's flavor! The burnt caramel ice cream is fantastic, and you can really taste the bourbon in the caramel swirls. The chocolate chunks are an excellent combo with the caramel, and the almond bits add a last bit of nice texture.\n",
            "This may be my new favorite flavor. I usually go for the Chunky Monkey, but saw this at the grocery store the other day and decided to give it a try, since I have recently switched from vodkas to whiskey and bourbons. Absolutely love everything about this flavor.\n",
            "This is my new favorite B&J!! The Bourdon swirl is perfect and I am quite surprised by how well the textured complimented one another. I do, however think the chocolate pieces could be smaller pieces and less portion of the pint. Otherwise, what an amazing mix.\n",
            "Just tried this flavor and it is great! Unlike some caramel ice cream it's not overwhelmingly sweet... there were fudge chunks and almonds in every bite and the caramel swirl was so well flavored that it had me checking the carton for alcohol content! Loved it!\n",
            "Okay, not really...but close. It was the best ice cream I've ever had!! And I'm a very good judge of ice cream. Not to sweet, well balanced. Great size of chocolate chunks & almond pieces. Smooth bourbon flavor. Delish!! Please don't EVER get rid of this!!\n",
            "The ice cream & swirl were good. But the almond bits were like little annoying tasteless splinters. And what kind of chocolate flakes are these? The chocolate in chunky monkey is great. This chocolate barely has a chocolate taste and no chocolate feel at all.\n",
            "This might be my favorite ice cream ever! I am addicted! I have always liked Ben & Jerry's but I've never been a regular consumer until this one. The crunch of the almonds and the chocolate with the caramel ice cream is perfect. Please don't let this one go!\n",
            "I usually hate caramel flavor ice cream because it's extremely sweet. However, this made me a believer. It has the perfect balance of sweet and alcohol and nuttiness with pop of dark chocolate. I love love love this flavor. Please don't discontinue it.\n",
            "I didnt like Urban Bourbon AT ALL. IMO there were way too many chocolate pieces. They were too big, they didn't melt and they had no flavor. And the texture of the almonds was terrible. They made the ice cream taste gritty. The carmel was cloying.\n",
            "Went out on a limb, usually I stick with my peanut butter ice creams. Holy cow!!! Seriously! THE MOST AMAZING ice cream EVER! The whole thing is the best concoction ever put together! Absolutely in LOVE! Please never stop making this flavor!\n",
            "It's good but I'm more a chocolate gal. Too much almonds. Which isn't a bad thing if it came with almond joys. ;) it IS good but not MY cup of tea. For the person who ventures outside the chocolate and coconut and creams, you'll love it.\n",
            "I just purchased this about 30 minutes ago to try. I do not like it. It tastes bitter and the after taste is worse. It’s too bad I can’t take it back to the store for a refund. Have to throw it away, like my money to purchase this.\n",
            "As a huge b&J fan I have gone through so many of flavours and continue to keep it mixed up and varied but since trying this one - I think I’m going to settle down! Absolutely gorgeous - I could spend the rest of my life with this one\n",
            "First bite and it was love!! Please... I beg you... never ever stop making Urban Bourbon!! Happiness is just a spoonful away in my freezer! Friends and family love it too. We all agree this is the best ice cream we ever tasted!!!!\n",
            "Urban Bourbon has the best texture! The nuts are chopped really small which enables you to get some in every bite. It took me a little while, but the bourbon caramel totally grew on me and now this flavor is one of my favorites.\n",
            "I have an enormous sweet tooth, and I rarely think anything is too sweet. I've also never been disappointed with any of the many B&J flavors I've eaten. That said, this was too sweet and had VERY little flavor. Cloyingly sweet.\n",
            "This has too many fudge flakes, which I thought is was dark chocolate. What Almonds? They just have chopped almonds that you will think are tiny pieces a fudge flakes/dark chocolate. The caramel ice cream and caramel were fine.\n",
            "We bought this with the new Truffle flavor. First bite it taste burnt as all get out. 2nd bite was a burnt alcohol taste. I couldn't stand it. And neither could my 3 year old who loves all flavors if ice cream- even coffee!\n",
            "I tried this since my fav flavor was out of stock. At first I liked it but as I took each bite I realized how I disliked all the nut slivers that were in each spoonful. There wasn’t enough bourbon caramel and too many nuts!\n",
            "I absolutely loved Urban Bourbon! I had every intention of eating just one serving but surprisingly when I looked down it was gone. Had to stop on the way home the next night to get more. Thanks for another great flavor!\n",
            "Got this when it was on BOGO because I love borboun and Ben and Jerrys. Oh man was it amazing! Only had a few bites with borboun flavor though... wish there was more. Otherwise, the combination of flavors was spot on!\n",
            "I took a chance on this flavor as I don't eat ice cream very often. IMHO I absolutely loved this flavor. The bourbon is very mild and the flavors came together very well. I had to stop my self from eating half a pint!\n",
            "All you need to say is “burnt caramel” and I’m sold. Though I don’t taste much bourbon the chocolate flakes, almonds and caramel pair wonderfully for a wonderfully interesting depth of flavors. Thank you Ben and Jerry\n",
            "Great idea for a flavor, but unfortunately too many+too small almond pieces. The base and fudge flakes are nice, but it's still kind of plain. The swirl is very good, but there was almost none present in my pint.\n",
            "When I usually try things labeled bourbon, I assume it will be kind of bourbony. The first bite I took of this I got the hints of \"burnt\" smoky flavor off the top and then the splash of bourbon and caramel. SO GOOD\n",
            "I don't taste any bourbon at all. It was just an overly sweet unpleasant caramel flavor. My family did not enjoy this. The fudge flakes are a distraction and too large and hard. Good idea, but not a unique taste.\n",
            "I was excited to try this flavor because I never buy Ben&Jerry but this is my new favorite. Every bite I took was exciting. All of the ingredients were equally amounted. I hope this flavor sticks around!\n",
            "Just now tried the Urban Bourbon flavor that I bought 2 weeks ago. It is BEYOND amazing. I may just have to find something to binge watch so I can eat the whole pint! I will be going back for more.\n",
            "This needs to stick around as a regular flavor! Everyone I've had try this thinks it's incredible. The slight taste of burbon in the swirls is out of this world!! Hands down my favorite of all time.\n",
            "When I opened the pint there was a huge blob of caramel at the top and then....nothing. A few chocolate chunks, but no more caramel, a few chocolate chunks and no \"bourbon\". It was disappointing.\n",
            "Literally one of the best things to ever go into my mouth. Honestly everything you do in your ice cream ventures is inspiring. You paint masterpieces for the taste pallet and for that i thank you\n",
            "The burnt caramel ice cream was soo overwhelming at first and not very pleasant at all. It left a horrible aftertaste. I won't be buying this flavor again but I'm excited to try other flavors.\n",
            "The ice cream itself is very grainy. Almost a sherbert texture. Not creamy at all. Way too much bittersweet chocolate chips and not enough caramel. I didn’t taste any bourbon either. Big fail.\n",
            "I literally eat this just about EVERY night. It's delicious & had the perfect blend of smooth/crunchy. I don't even typically like chocolate ice cream, but Urban Bourbon is put of this world.\n",
            "My favorite flavor used to be in New York New York now it's urban bourbon I love the caramel center the fudge this is the best ice cream I have ever eaten I eat it at least once a week\n",
            "This is my new favorite flavor, since I can't peach cobbler anywhere anymore. I'm a sucker for ice cream with nuts and appreciate the meld of caramel, chocolate, and walnut flavors.\n",
            "All the flavors go so well together. The chocolate and especially the almonds both have different hardness which means the crunch is so satisfying. Easily my favorite flavor so far.\n",
            "My first taste was great, but the ice cream had too much almond meal in it, and not enough burnt taste or bourbon taste. I loved the chocolate flakes, but I wouldn't buy it again\n",
            "So, I'm not a big fan of ice cream but when my husband brought this home I decided to give it a try. I finally found an ice cream that I LOVE! It has great texture and flavor.\n",
            "For me replaces the previous bourbon flavor that i feel that was just to hard fpr people to pronounce! Seems that they got a good one w/this one! I hope its a keeper for awhile!\n",
            "I'm really enjoying this ice cream but I'm wondering if I should worry about the whiskey, I am pregnant. I'm sure its not a big deal but curious couldn't find any warnings.\n",
            "I eat A LOT of B&J...this is hands down my new favorite. Texturally, I’m not sure it needs the almonds AND fudge chips, but the flavor more than makes up for it. Cheers!\n",
            "I love that the almonds pieces are small and fully incorporated! The \"burnt\" caramel is absolute perfection and the bourbon swirl....well, it doesn't get any better!\n",
            "Delicious new flavor but the almonds are pulverized and in every bite. It pretty much ruins the creaminess I want from ice cream. It's a bummer. I won't buy again.\n",
            "Bought this tonight at Walmart. The ice cream actually tastes like hazelnut to me. It had luscious chunks of chocolate in every bite. Will definitely buy again.\n",
            "The Tonight Dough was a long running favorite until I sank my spoon into a pint of urban bourbon. Hands down the best ice cream I’ve had from Ben & Jerry’s.\n",
            "So sad this contains Barley so it's a no go for a celiac. So many of your flavors have Barley now. Guess I'm just out of luck with my old favorite brand.\n",
            "Bought mostly for a different taste; not exciting, lotsa almond slices. These, made me happy though. Good caramel and not overly chocolate (big bonus) :)\n",
            "I decided to give this a try and fell in love! This has the right mix of caramel and Chocolate pieces and the flavor is JUST right. Highly recommend!\n",
            "My husband picked this up by accident and I'm so glad he did. This is my new favorite flavor. It sweet, toasted, and a little boozy - just perfect!\n",
            "Crunchy almonds and perfectly sized chocolate chunks...bourbon swirl...heavenly flavored ice cream. Sweet Lord, pleeease never retire this flavor!\n",
            "I just bought this tonight and it has to be my new favorite! Its not super sweet and has plenty of crunch. I had such a hard time putting it down.\n",
            "Love this so much. The toasty burnt flavor of the ice cream is awesome and nice balance with the gooey swirl. I hope this never goes away\n",
            "Very decadent and a perfect treat. The bourbon flavor is not too strong (fine by me). Love the deep caramel and the crunch from the nuts!\n",
            "So good! Please don't discontinue! Wasn't sure about it on the shelf but gave it a try and so happy I did! Perfect \"grown up\" ice cream!\n",
            "I had this flavor a few months ago and loved it. Call me crazy...but I swear it didn't have almonds before. I hate almonds in ice cream.\n",
            "I was a little skeptical on seeing a bourbon flavored ice cream... but wow! This is amazing! They can't keep it in the stores here!\n",
            "The Almonds are very small and soft. Not very enjoyable. I had bought it for my Husband but he doesn't like nut so he took mine.\n",
            "This the best! Salty, sweet with distinct bourbon Carmel flavor. Love it. I usually only find it at Safeway.\n",
            "More please!!\n",
            "This is amazing,the Carmel is so good!!! Lots of chunks and Carmel,no need to go mining for the good stuff.I love it !!!\n",
            "Perfect mix of caramel, almonds and bourbon, but my favorite part was the dark chocolate slivers.\n",
            "My new favorite!\n",
            "By far the best flavor yet, so hooked! Though not many flavors I've tried aren't delicious from Ben and Jerry's :)\n",
            "Highly upset that I cannot find this anymore. One of the absolute best flavours to come out of B&J in a long time.\n",
            "Honestly the best ice cream ever. I️ love the carmel with the bourbon and the almonds and it’s just so delicious.\n",
            "Just found this and wow! It's crime brûlée mixed with yummy chocolate goodness, Amazing gooeyness!\n",
            "Thanks!\n",
            "We started buying this about two months ago, and absolutely love it! PLEASE make it for every!! You’re the best\n",
            "I like this one a lot. The burnt caramel ice cream is super tasty, and I always love the addition of liquor.\n",
            "I ama new York chocolate chunk guy but I tried this one and I truly believe I have found a new favorite.\n",
            "New & already one of our favorites! If you like a sweet bourbon flavor, definitely give it a try!\n",
            "Wow best ice cream ever. Please never stop making it. Please please please don't change a thing!\n",
            "Nice bourbon flavor going on with the caramel. You also can't go wrong with chocolate chunks.\n",
            "Really love this flavor! The ratio of everything is perfect! Please continue making this one!\n",
            "I bought this a few weeks ago and I love love love it!!!\n",
            "Great flavors and plenty of almonds\n",
            "The ice cream is so good. All the flavors come together and the nuts make it tast the best.\n",
            "My favorite. I eat it in like a minute, especially when it is a little bit melted!!!!\n",
            "Usually my husband likes one flavor and I like another but we both love urban bourbon\n",
            "I saw that there was a new flavor and I decided to try it so glad that I did amazing\n",
            "My new favorite flavor-yum! I kinda wonder what it would taste like with pecans....\n",
            "I've only found this flavor once and I'm obsessed now! I can't find it again :(((\n",
            "After I was done with my pint that hour, I went to the store and bought another\n",
            "We keep buying it over and over! The flavor and textures inside are perfect.\n",
            "So good that I wrote a review, I never do this!! It's is my new favorite!!!\n",
            "I really recommend this one. It tastes like bourbon but sweeter! So good!\n",
            "I eat the entire tub in one sitting because it’s that good and addicting.\n",
            "The ice cream has great flavor great taste live the burbon swirls in it\n",
            "It’s so amazing. I sent my husband out for another for dessert tonight!\n",
            "This might be my favorite flavor of all. It's a caramel bourbon dream\n",
            "everthing i like in my ice cream just didn't know until yall made it\n",
            "Bought this and was amazed. Had all the flavors I was looking for.\n",
            "I totally consumed the whole pint! Better than a raspberry cosmo.\n",
            "It's soooo good. The chocolate chips are my favorite part. Buy it!\n",
            "One of my favs. Everything about this ice cream is perfection.\n",
            "Sooooooo delicious! My new favorite. You gotta try this one!\n",
            "There is equal greatness in every bite. The flavor is great.\n",
            "So, so good, and so unexpected. One of my favorite flavors!\n",
            "Great flavors great chocolate amazing texture! Thank you!\n",
            "One of the best kinds I have ever tried.. really amazing.\n",
            "Just bought this today at Kroger and it is amazing Good!\n",
            "One of my new favorites! So good! Go ahead and try it.\n",
            "I love the balance of Bourbon, caramel and chocolate.\n",
            "I love this ice cream flavor! Don’t ever discontinue\n",
            "I spotted this the other day...now my new favorite!\n",
            "Best Vanilla Ice cream ever! And I have tried quite a number of them\n",
            "I mean it, folks! This is by far the best Vanilla ice cream available. It doesn’t get better. It’s creamy, dense, sweet, rich and very natural tasting. It’s the essence of Vanilla; very intense. It also has a great mouth feel. Yes, it isn’t full of chunks, swirls and mix-ins but that doesn’t mean it’s boring. On the contrary, each bite is an exploration of what it means to taste true Vanilla. Honestly it’s the best.\n",
            "My favorite ice cream flavor is vanilla. Simple, sweet, savory, creamy, delicious vanilla. I've tried dozens of fancy/gourmet brands of vanilla and always come back to Ben & Jerry's. It's got great vanilla flavor and just the right amount of salt to the cream to make this savory and not bland at all.\n",
            "The best vanilla ice cream ever! It doesn't need anything added, it's great all by itself.\n",
            "Great Flavor! Vanilla Beans! Nothing else added. Its a great flavor when you want something simple.\n",
            "My favorite flavor is vanilla that has vanilla bean. Almost every evening after dinner, I have one-third pint of Ben & Jerry's vanilla ice cream. In my mouth, it feels creamy and melts at a medium pace allowing me to savor the full vanilla flavor. This vanilla ice cream is perfect in every way. Thank you.\n",
            "I am thrilled that you have Non GMO choices. Thank you. But guar gum, locust beans and caragean are still off limits to most of us allergic people. Can you please make one choice just milk, sugar and vanilla?\n",
            "The best vanilla ice cream I’ve ever had! Super soft and creamy!\n",
            "Taste it once in Singapore. I'll never forget that taste.\n",
            "Well it's too thick because it's packed with sugar and cream.\n",
            "I must have gotten a bad batch. Mine looks nothing like the photo. I got vanilla ice cream with a glob caramel core. It was awful. I ate a little to see if the swirls would show up, but no. It was just vanilla ice cream. I threw the rest away. Complete waste of money. Very disappointed.\n",
            "I’m 62 and have loved B&J ice creams since first invented. I’ve probably cut a year or two off my life and don’t mind abit. Why? Because of this particular flavor combination. It’s the bees knees & the cats meow all rolled up into one sweet swirl. Once you try this, your flavor dreams will be fulfilled forever. This is the only B&J flavor combination I’d every want to be stranded on a desert island with, just me and my Vanilla-Caramel-Fudge Swirl! This is the creamiest, fudgiest, carameliest, tastiest, smoothest ice evermade. Dont wait, just go get some and enjoy every last lick!\n",
            "I LOVE this flavor. It is flawless with just the right amount of caramel and fudge against the vanilla ice cream. Please never alter or retire this flavor!\n",
            "Nothing fancy, but definitely one of my favorites! If you are thinking of trying it you'll be glad you did!\n",
            "This was my favorite years ago and was discontinued. I found it in my local grocery store and have been happy ever since. No chucks! I just don't like chewing my ice cream. The fudge and carmel is loaded in the ice cream. Pure awesomeness!!\n",
            "dont ever ever ever! you knocked it out of the park and if you ever get rid of this flavor i will cry endlessly and be depressed until the end of my days. its amazing. so SO amazing.\n",
            "Whenever I look for Ben and Jerry's, this is what I seek.\n",
            "Love this flavor but it is not available in my area. According to the web site it should be at. A certain store but the store does not have it\n",
            "I have loved this flavor for as long as I can remember, although now it is very hard to find in stores now, only a Wawa I work close to carries it and maybe shop rite...now that there is a perfect ice cream, when can I get some coupons so I can actually afford it and eat it more often....I tried many other flavors and nothing compares to vanilla caramel fudge....NOTHING!!!!\n",
            "i always look for this flavor, once i had it I couldnt stop! Reminded me of the VANILLA FUDGE ice cream i had as a child.\n",
            "BUT now, Shoprite near me, in Southern NJ., doesn't carry it, Was told that it was discontinued!!!!\n",
            "Please advise.\n",
            "I will always mourn Wavy Gravy, but this flavor has been a long-time favorite of mine. This is the only B&J's flavor that I continue to eat....haven't liked the new flavors for many years, and some of the older flavors now lack quality (ex: Cherry Garcia, NYSFC, and CC Cookie Dough). Please do not retire Vanilla Caramel Fudge!!!\n",
            "It tried it while in Paris for my studies many moons ago and fell in love with it instantly. It's been canceled in France and Switzerland for many years and I'm waiting desperately for it to come back.\n",
            "The simple mix of caramel and chocolate sauce with the vanilla ice cream is just perfect.\n",
            "I found this flavor in my local market about a month ago and it instantly became my all time favorite!! Creamy vanilla ice cream and caramel and fudge rippled all through it smooth creamy perfection straight out of the container!! Ice cream dream come true thank you Ben & Jerry’s\n",
            "The greatest flavor, so creamy with lovely fudge and caramel generously infused. Only problem can never find it at the local grocery store which I don’t understand because they NEVER have it. Did B&G quit making this flavor? The only flavor I like and it’s never available :(:(\n",
            "This is my all time favorite B & J ice cream. I was very disappointed when it ended up in the Flavor Graveyard, but was then resurrected. I like to think it was because of me and my diligent feedback to B & J to resurrect it. Probably not, but one can think.\n",
            "Not a fan of chocolate chunks in my ice cream, which takes a lot of B&J's flavors out of the running, but this is my all time favorite! Real FUDGE and caramel with the creamiest vanilla. I can't find it everywhere, so when I do, I stock up.\n",
            "I love many Ben & Jerry's flavors but this is by far my favorite. Vanilla base of goodness with it's simple yumminess complimented by generous amounts of two of the greatest flavors ever combined, caramel and fudge!\n",
            "I found this 2 months ago and can't get enough. Has nice amounts of both fudge and caramel. Reminds me of the old vanilla fudge swirl ice creams that you can't find anymore. But this one gives you caramel too!\n",
            "I have always been a Cherry Garcia fan, and tried others here and there, but this is the best ice cream that I have ever tasted. I had to stop myself from eating the whole pint in one sitting.\n",
            "Whenever I'm eating B&J Vanilla Caramel Fudge ice cream I feel a song in my heart ...\"If Loving You Is Wrong, I Don't Want To Be Right\". This is good stuff...no chunks!\n",
            "Wish I found it much sooner absolutely my all-time favorite ice cream wish it came in a larger size absolutely the best flavor ever perfect combination of everything!\n",
            "I love love love this ice cream and buy it every week and try not to eat the whole pint in one sitting. It is the best ice cream I have ever eaten.\n",
            "I love this flavor but haven't been able to find it at the store I normally got it was just wondering if it has been out of stock or discontinued\n",
            "I wanted a pint with no chunks, so I tried this one. I think it’s my new favorite! There’s a ton of caramel and fudge swirls in it.\n",
            "I’m normally a Cherry Garcia lover but wanted something more simple. Spotted this and took it home. It’s now my new favorite!\n",
            "This is by far my favorite Ben & Jerry’s flavor. Smooth vanilla ice cream with fudge and caramel ribbons. Delicious!\n",
            "I'm eating this right now!! It's like a sundae in a pint! Have you considered adding whipped cream?\n",
            "I bought this product little fudge and Carmel. Quality control.\n",
            "This is my husband's favorite, for sure. I love it, too.\n",
            "So I typically buy these a lot! I’m actually kinda obsessed, this is my absolute favorite. Although I’ve noticed lately the cookie “core” isn’t much of a core anymore rather than just a little piece. I’m pretty disappointed as I’ve gone far enough to write a review. I posted a picture to show how small it’s become. This is with me eating around it, by the way.\n",
            "Now this is one of the few cores I've taken a liking to. The consistency of the cookie core is in an interesting one....smooth enough, but not exactly \"cookie-like,\" however, this does not mean it is not good. This ice cream can become quite a bit as you move towards the bottom of the pint, but I think if you're a seasoned ice cream veteran you could power through to the end. I do however wish there was a bit more vanilla to counteract the cookie core and mocha flavors, but this isn't exactly a complaint; perhaps my pint had a somewhat skewed ratio of vanilla:cookie:mocha.\n",
            "THIS ICE CREAM IS THE BEST YET OUT OF THE B@J'S SMOOTH DECEDANT COOKIE CORE COLLECTION! I TRIED THE BROWNIE BATTER BUT THERE WASN'T ENOUGH BATTER TO PLEASE! BUT THIS ONE HAS THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF EVERYTHING IN IT AND THE CORE IS A BUTTERY CHOCOLATY COOKIE BONANZA!! TRY IT AND U WON'T STOP! I'VE EATEN A PINT EVERY NIGHT FOR TWO WEEKS! BE CAREFUL YOU'LL GET HOT AND HUNGARY FOR THIS ONE AND IF U HAVE TO YOU'LL PAWN A DIAMOND RING FOR THIS ADDICTION! HEHE! ANDRE'\n",
            "This is my all time favorite flavor from B&J, and after an exceptionally grating day, I went to my local grocer to find this pint, only to find (for the third visit this month) that it wasn't there... Defeated, I searched the flavor and came across the locator page on the website and found not one, but ten different places nearby had it! Tears were shed, angels sang, the day was quite literally saved by Ben and Jerry, and their Boom Chocolata flavor. Thanks so much\n",
            "I love both sides of the ice cream! Both absolutely delicious! The mocha is to die for and the chocolate cookie and fudge flakes make for great textural and flavor components. That’s the first ‘50’ in the title of my review. The second ‘50’ is the core. While it was thick and went all the way to the bottom, the flavor is just frankly very unpleasant in my opinion. The texture of the core is also strange; gritty, grainy, hard and pasty. If this were a standard pint, not a Core, it would be a total knockout 100% awesome pint which I would buy regularly. As it is though, I think I’m done.\n",
            "I just tried this for the first time and I am absolutely hooked! I could live without the fudge chips, but the rest of the concoction is above reproach. The caramel side is delicate & flavorful all on its own, the mocha side is a fantastic coffee kick with subtle notes of rich chocolate. The chocolate cookie core is very true to delicious cookie consistency, I did not find any issue with the texture or taste, and I'm very sensitive. This may well be my favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor ever. I'll weep hysterically in the streets if it is discontinued. 11/10 stars\n",
            "My all-time fave!!! Please don't ever discontinue!\n",
            "When I took my first bite of mocha, caramel, and cookie core all on the spoon together my eyes closed and it was like I was one of those actors on a commercial that lick their lips, and the backdrop is clouds. Then I kept eating, and the cookie core never ended. It was the the best ice-cream-eating experience I've ever had.\n",
            "Thank you for this flavor Ben & Jerry's. Thank you for your ice cream.\n",
            "This ice cream flavor is great but there are a few problems with it.\n",
            "Overall it's quite delicious, but quickly turns the smile into a frown.\n",
            "I just recently found this ice cream and I absolutely love it but I can't find it anymore in stores. Please tell me it's not going away?\n",
            "Didn't know what to expect when I bought this about a month ago but know I crave it all the time. Best flavor so far\n",
            "This particular flavor was disappointing because the cookie core and cookie chunks were an acrid flavor. I've been trying to finish the pint not wanting to be wasteful but the cookie is def off. Never had to leave anything less than 5 star for every other flavor tho. Love you guys!!\n",
            "I buy this two or three times a week. I absolutely love it! I’m concerned though. The local drug store quit carrying it a few months ago and now my local grocery store has a “close out” sign on the display. PLEASE don’t tell me this flavor is being discontinued! I don’t want to live in a world without Boom Chocolatta Cookie Core!\n",
            "This is my absolute favorite ice cream flavor. I will choose it over every other flavor time and time again. I cannot imagine ever getting bored of this ice cream. It has the perfect ratio of chocolate to coffee and the core!!!!!! Oh, the core... it is exquisite. I can eat this by the bucket loads. Ben and Jerry's won me over with this flavor. They have other good ones too but they pale in comparison to my beloved Boom Chocolatta!\n",
            "This is hands down my favorite flavor! I go through phases every few years where I am extremely loyal to one flavor and will refuse to venture out. Eventually a flavor comes out that might sound like it could be good and I’ll give it a shot. Oh this was SO worth it. I am currently going through minimum a pint a week! AHH!\n",
            "I feel so bad for all the other flavours because I can't go past this amazing combo. The cookie core is hard but crumbly when applied with enough pressure and the texture is kind of gritty - it's fantastic! i try hard not to eat it all in one go but I can't stop the cookie train once it's started.\n",
            "The Exquisite taste as well as texture all goes so smoothly with each other that it makes the perfect combination of an extreme delightful explosion of taste in your mouth. It almost has a hint of like a coffee type of flavoring but not to a broad of a taste it's just exquisite.\n",
            "Have you guys stopped making these? I can't find these any stores here in Cary, NC. I love this ice cream and this is the only icecream I have been eating for that past 5 years. Please don't stop making it. The cookie core is the best of the best part. From your most loyal fan.\n",
            "I never thought I wouldn't like one of B&J ice creams, but this one might be the one. The cookie core has a sandy texture and a weird flavour I cannot describe. It doesn'e even taste like cookies.\n",
            "The ice creams themselves (minus the cookie core) are great.\n",
            "i can't explain how happy i am that you guys have created this magnificent flavor. the burst of chocolate chunks and mocha flavor and the oh so wonderful cookie core. there's nothing more perfect that i'd rather put in my mouth\n",
            "By far the best flavor you guys have ever produced but I haven't been able to find it in Australia for a while now. Why did you guys discontinue it?? :( Is there any way at all I can get more, I am desperate here!!! </3\n",
            "Flavor is on point. When \"Boom Chocolatta\" first came out the core was huge and went straight to the bottom, now it's like a narrow funnel. Starts small and get's smaller with every bite. Bring back the full cores!\n",
            "As someone who loves coffee and chocolate, this ice cream rocked my world. The cookie core is addicting and the subtle gentleness of the caramel ice cream marries every element of this flavor perfectly.\n",
            "Had to special order a case . This is by far my all time favorite ice cream !!! Everything about it is just amazing ! Please never discontinue . I drove all over Florida looking for this flavor\n",
            "Seriously this has been a favorite for a long time. Lots of flavors and textures and the cookie core is AMAZING LIKE BLENDED OREOS BUT BETTER. Really fantastic ice cream, that never gets old.\n",
            "This is my all time favorite, anytime I see it I have to buy! I personally LOVE the cookie core, it’s so smooth. Always recommend this flavor in particular to friends because I’m obsessed.\n",
            "I could eat this flavor everyday forever! It has just the right flavor combination and the cookie core is by far the best core out of them all. The texture is just right! Yum!\n",
            "I love this core flavor! The center tastes just like ground up oreos, and it compliments the mocha and caramel ice creams very well. Highly recommended!\n",
            "My husband or kid? Leaves me the ice cream while my favorite textured cookie core is no where to be found! More CORE pleeeeease!!!\n",
            "This is my number one favorite ice cream ever! Please do not discontinue. When I bought this for the first time, I just couldn't stop buying it. The caramel ice cream with the chocolate mocha ice cream is such a perfect combination. It's so good to the point where I couldn't even make it home to freezer I had to eat it on the way. I would purchase it everyday if I could but it's so hard to find where I live in the country. I'm exaggerating a bit okay at least every week.\n",
            "Just like another reviewer said, it's mud pie in a pint. Officially hands down my favorite ice cream ever\n",
            "This is my favorite of all the ice creams. Or at least it's the one that I buy every time I see it, because it's hard to find in my area. I've always gotten it at Target, but they seem to have replaced the cookie core flavors with the new cookie dough core flavors. Don't get me wrong, I am loving these new cookie dough core flavors too. But I miss my Boom Chocolatta. :( I was getting nervous they might have retired it. :O Thank goodness it appears that's not the case!\n",
            "I have bought this flavor more times than I can count. I love the gritty texture of the chocolate cookie core and pretty much carve it out and save it until the very end. I LOVE the caramel ice cream, and though I enjoy the coffee half pretty well, I have a sensitivity to caffeine so it amps me up a little too much. Obviously, that doesn't stop me from buying it and eating the entire thing! Very yummy! It was my go to before I found my love, milk and cookies.\n",
            "This is my favoritie flavors from Ben and Jerrys, but i have one problem. I love the caramel flavoring but not so much the mocha. I wish you guys would sell each flavor separately as well as together in order to satisfy both cravings. This way customers like me will be able to have a whole container of ice cream rather than buying the cookie core for one flavor and throwing the other half away.\n",
            "This flavor is my absolute favorite! Recently I’ve developed an intolerance to caffeine (I can have some, but not much). I just bought boom chocolatta for the first time since this development, but I can’t find anything about this ones caffeine content specifically. It’d be wonderful you guys would be willing to post the caffeine content if you ice creams, if there is any. Thank you!\n",
            "I mean it quiet literally when I say that this is the best Ben and Jerry's ever. It's the only reason I would continuously pay the high prices of this brand. Unfortunately it has disappeared from my area (Monmouth county, NJ) over the past few weeks and I've been so disappointed. Please bring it back\n",
            "I like the combination of ice cream flavors. I also like that there is not My only suggestion would be to change the chocolate cookie pieces to chocolate chip cookie pieces, as the core is pretty much the same flavor as the chocolate cookie pieces. It is so good! More chocolate chips please!\n",
            "The cookie core is great. It's thick and smooth with a slightly sandy texture (not a bad thing). I'm not a huge fan of coffee ice cream, but this was still enjoyable. The mocha ice cream won't take away from the other flavors in here. I wish there were more chocolate cookie mix ins.\n",
            "This was the first Ben and Jerry's flavor that I've tried and it's so good. The mocha ice cream goes well with the Caramel ice cream, even though it looks like it is classic vanilla and chocolate. That core is golden. It's delicious and smooth. I would eat just the core if I could.\n",
            "My husband found this in the store along with another flavor. By far the best discovery in the ice cream section in a long time. This had a perfect amount of everything not too much not too little and has me wanting more!! Thanks Ben & Jerry’s, I know I can count on you!\n",
            "I love this flavor! It can be hard to find sometimes (it seems really popular) but I get it nearly every time. The taste is AMAZING!!! I love the way the mocha and caramel work together, and with the fudge and chocolate? Incredible. Great work with this one, guys!\n",
            "I just bought this ice cream for the first time, and was sort of disappointed. The core only lasted about 1/3 of the way down the pint and the base of the ice cream was extremely bland. I had heard good things about this ice cream so I'm not sure what happened.\n",
            "This is the BEST ice cream ever, I buy it every week, its my favorite because of the huge core... but lately the last several I have bought have had either no core at all, or a very tiny spoonful of core at the very bottom.\n",
            "Not happy with it lately.\n",
            "I don’t typically write reviews but I hope this flavor sticks around! Between this and The Tonight dough, I’ve never been disappointed. This is my go-to whenever I need a little pick me up after working long hours with children who have special needs.\n",
            "This is one of my new favorite Ice Creams. The only things that would make it better, is if the core were a little bigger, and they only put the coffee ice cream in. The caramel ice cream, while delicious, doesn't meld as well with the cookie core.\n",
            "This has been my fave for a few years now. It's like chocolate heaven with a cookie core. It's not too rich like the brownie and fudge flavors. For some reason Boom chocolatta is getting hard to find. Please don't discontinue this one Ben and Jerry!\n",
            "Eating this right now and so disappointed. There is barely any cookie in here and the ice cream is very bland. Too smooth, needs more chunks. This is basically just coffee ice cream with a couple small pieces of cookie that barely even register.\n",
            "When gen and jerry's doesn't have a new ice cream out, I have 2-3 go to Ben and jerry's and cycle between them and this is one of the,. I love the cookie core. It's delicious and has two different ice cream flavors wrapped around it? Awesome!\n",
            "The flavor mash-uo is absolutely incredible—the mocha flavor is paired perfectly with the vanilla and melt-in-your mouth chocolate cookie core. It is drool-worthy. Thank you B&J—please never discontinue it!\n",
            "Im not a huge ice cream fan. I am however a huge cookie fan and this hits the spot. it's got the right balance of flavors and the cookie is nice and smooth. on my bad part is its so hard to find in my area.\n",
            "This is amazing!!!!! The cookie core is so much better than traditional cookies and cream ice creams. I also love the chocolate flakes. It is really hard to find at the stores around me though :(\n",
            "I am addicted to this flavor! It is a mixture of delicious and frankly, feel it’s the best flavor Ben &Jerrys ever made. I’m super happy with this flavor and will not be switching anytime soon.\n",
            "Love love love this flavor! The ice cream is so good and I love the core. Please don't change it! The cookie core reminds me of the cookie crumble in Carvel ice cream cakes growing up.\n",
            "This is one if my favorite of your ice creams but the past two points I have bought, the cookie core stopped about 1/4 way through... do you know why this is? We love your ice cream!!\n",
            "I am obsessed. This ishands down the best iced cream flavor I've every had. Noone can convince me other wise. If this ever were to be discontinued I legit would cry over it.\n",
            "The store was out of the Tonight Dough so I bought this flavor instead. I am not sure if the Tonight Dough just set a really high bar or if this flavor really is mediocre.\n",
            "This ice cream was amazing. The flavor and the texture were perfection. Do yourself a favor and buy this ice cream immediately. Especially if you are PMSing.\n",
            "This is one of my favorite flavors. I go to a specific grocery store just because they carry this flavor. The cookie core and mocha ice cream is delicious!\n",
            "Once I found this icecream, I never went back. The flavors are amazing and this flavor has the best core of all the other core icecreams. Nothing compares!\n",
            "I buy this flavor whenever I can find it. It’s hands down the best one but so difficult to find anywhere. Please never, ever discontinue Boom Chocolatta!\n",
            "Couldn't find Chocolate Therapy, so decided to try Boom Chocolatta! Cookie Core. Wow, I may never go back. The substitute therapist was awesome.\n",
            "This flavor is pretty simple, vanilla and chocolate ice cream with chocolate chunks. My favorite part is the core, it tastes like and Oreo\n",
            "I love this ice cream and my favorite part is the core, but to my surprise the core quickly ran out about 1/2 of the way down. Very sad.\n",
            "To my surprise, this has been the best ice cream flavor I have ever snuck into the movie theaters. It was so good... I wrote a review\n",
            "Pretty disappointing, core doesn’t go pretty far down like the others and cookies were kind of dry. There is room for improvement.\n",
            "i'm crazy about ben and jerrys caramel ice cream and with thur mocha it's a perfect mixture plus that alcoholic core omg!!!\n",
            "It's my go-to ice cream when I'm sad and need to watch a good chick-flick...but is also great for other occasions!!\n",
            "Love it! I think the cookie part could be a little less sweet, it crunches; but other than that...great!\n",
            "Best yet however it’s like it was a tease because I haven’t been able to find in over a year in Rogers Arkansas\n",
            "Pure bliss. 11/10. If I had to choose 2 ice creams before I died I would choose this one as one of them.\n",
            "How can so much deliciousness be packed into a pint? So good, they should sell it by prescription.\n",
            "This has me hooked and no other flavors will do. I hope this is NEVER discontinued. Best B&J EVER!\n",
            "I just bought this the other day and I had my sister go out and buy me more because I’m addicted.\n",
            "This is such a perfectly balanced pint of ice cream! Textures and flavors together are so good!\n",
            "Obsessed with this flavor! The cookie core is the best part and I wish there was more of it.\n",
            "Best flavor ever. Great anxiety and stress reliever. Do not ever get rid of this flavor\n",
            "I've been looking for Mud Pie for years. Finally I've found it, in a pint of Ben & Jerry's!\n",
            "This was the ice-cream I would usually buy with my parents at the store, and It’s my go to.\n",
            "Love the cookie core all the flavors and ingredients work well together my favorite by far\n",
            "the cookie core with the mocha and caramel ice cream surrounding it is truly phenomenal\n",
            "we got it a week ago and we enjoy very much and we will got it again.\n",
            "There has never been a better flavor. This is the best. Period. That’s it. The end.\n",
            "Love this flavor! And would love the mocha ice cream as a base for a new flavor!\n",
            "I had a whole tub of this to myself it’s that good - it’s my new favourite\n",
            "Best ice cream I ever ate! If I could get just the core Is the best part\n",
            "best ice cream ever I'm normally a chocolate lover but this is a new fav\n",
            "This is pretty much the best thing I've ever had in my entire life\n",
            "First time trying this & it tasted amazing !! Love the cookie core\n",
            "I eat this ice cream at least 3 times a month I am I love with it\n",
            "This ice cream is full of fun flavors and textures. 5/5 stars.\n",
            "This ice cream is so hard to put down and impossible to share.\n",
            "I look for this flavor everywhere I go. Absolutely delicious\n",
            "i buy this solely for the cookie crisp core- it’s so good.\n",
            "This flavor is amazing! You guys rock. Thank you so much\n",
            "I literaly just finished a pint before writing this!\n",
            "I've bought it every day since I first tried it!!!\n",
            "This is by the far the best ice cream flavor ever!\n",
            "I love Ben & Jerry’s which is why I am writing this review - I feel they would care to know how disappointing this flavor is! The core in the pint I purchased was super small, making it a total disappointment. I kept digging hoping it would get bigger and it just ended up almost disappearing. The ice cream as always was delicious, but I felt I would’ve been more satisfied with my old favorite standby, half baked.\n",
            "i am so upset that this didnt meet any of my expectations. the cookie “dough” is just grainy sugar! not to mention i get more cookie dough out of a regular ben & jerry’s cookie dough or even half baked than what i got in this. this needs a reboot! please consider making the core out of your oringinal cookie dough recipe!\n",
            "I was so excited for this because I love cookie dough but there’s never enough. I thought the core would look how it’s advertised. Spoiler alert: It didn’t. Barely any dough. Didn’t go all the way through consistently and couldn’t even be in the center. Also the dough didn’t taste great? Idk why but I like the vanilla better. Should have read the reviews first it was such a let down and I feel like I wasted my money.\n",
            "Even after reading all the reviews that said it wasn't good I still went and bought it anyways because it looked & sounded so good, but sadly the reviews are right. most of the time with cookie dough ice cream I wish there was more cookie dough (i thought this would be the super cookie-doughy flavor i always dreamed of.. theres not even that much in it), but with this pint i actually prefer the part around the core that doesn't have any. ben & jerry if u see this please re-make this flavor with better quality cookie dough, it had so much potential\n",
            "I preordered this as soon as they announced that it was available in the online store. I was so excited to dig in but while the ice cream is delicious, the cookie dough core is terrible. Rock hard, gritty, sandy, and very inconsistent in size from the top of the pint to the bottom. I hate having to write this review, especially because the other 2 new cookie cores were pretty good, but this one is REALLY dreadful! I’m really bummed because I wanted badly to love it.\n",
            "I waited and waited for this to be available at my local store. Yuck. Hard, grainy cookie dough core? This is nothing like cookie dough. Don’t be fooled, the cookie dough core is SMALL! I’m a Ben and Jerry’s fan, but you lost me here. So disappointed!\n",
            "Such a let down from Ben and Jerry’s. The cookie dough core was hard, dry, and basically tasted like granulated sugar. I am so underwhelmed by all the cores but this one was by far the most disappointing. Stick to the regular pints: my opinion best flavor is Gimme S’more.\n",
            "Bought this last night and was incredibly disappointed. Never write reviews but don’t buy this. The cookie dough was literally like sweet sand. It was gritty and grainy. Threw us away after about 5 bites. I’ll stick to the original Cookie Dough.\n",
            "I bought this, excited to try it as cookie dough is my favorite. Well the core was rock solid. It had to be eaten in 1 huge chunk instead of mixing with the ice cream. Very disappointed!\n",
            "I will not buy this again. It's good ice cream, but the \"core\" is a joke. People buy cookie dough ice cream for , surprise... the cookie dough. This \"core\" tastes like grainy sugar and shortening and not like cookie dough at all. And there's less than ever. The company found a way to give customers less if what they want with the hopes that all the hype about \"new and improved\" sways people. Well, I'm not fooled and I believe most others won't be either. It's overpriced and a big disappointment. I repeat, I will not buy again.\n",
            "I just bought this with very high expectations because the regular Cookie Dough flavor is amazing. The cookie dough core tastes like pure brown sugar. I would definitely not buy this again unless they made it taste like the original cookie dough flavor.\n",
            "The idea sounded so amazing, so I did not think it could possibly be as bad as the reviews said it was...Well I was wrong, it is actually worse. The ice cream itself is fine, but the core tastes like just brown sugar crystals. Not even remotely the same flavor or texture as their normal cookie dough. Did someone actually taste this before signing off on it? This is a total miss and anyone who was fooled into buying it should be provided a refund.\n",
            "This is not the same flavor as the well known Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough.\n",
            "I bought this at target because they didn’t have the original cookie dough I liked. It’s not good y’all. The dough seems like a new recipe. It’s got an odd texture, like sugar grains didn’t mix well and the chocolate chips are weird. The worst part is there’s not enough weird dough compared to the vanilla ice cream. I hope the old cookie dough hasn’t been replaced with this!\n",
            "I was really excited to see this in my grocer’s freezer. Having had karamel sutra core with its strong ratio of caramel to ice cream, I thought it would be great to get a nice glob of cookie dough going down the center of the pint. Instead, I was left incredibly disappointed with hardly any cookie dough in the entire container. Even worse, the dough included seemed to be dry and crumbly compared to what I’m used to in regular cookie dough. Very disappointing, I won’t be buying this one again unless they improve the formulation and increase the cookie dough. Worst b&j pint I’ve ever purchased.\n",
            "The regular chocolate chip cookie dough is my favorite and has been for YEARS, its soooo BOMB!! This iteration of it is absolutely disgusting the cookie core is not dough its literally just sugar, and it doesnt even go throughout the entire pint, not even half, not even in the center , its the grossest thing .Some of the other cores are really good which is why i gave this one a try but how could you get chocolate chip cookie dough wrong . I dont normally write reviews but I felt like i HAD to warn someone.\n",
            "When I first heard this flavor was coming out I was so excited. I waited 4 weeks to get my hands on one of these and finally found one yesterday at Wawa. I read the reviews before purchasing this, but decided to give this the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, everyone was right. The cookie dough has a sandy texture and crumbles to pieces and it doesn't taste very good either. Plus the core didnt even go all the way to the bottom of the container...definately wasn't worth the $5.99 I paid for it. :(\n",
            "Wow I love ben and jerrys but this one is sad. I debated between this one and another core one but chose this one due to my love of cookie dough. Well I wish I read the reviews first because they were incredibly right. Grainy cookie dough and the core in mine didn't even go half way down!!!\n",
            "At first I thought my taste buds were off, but no...the dough really just tastes (and feels like) brown sugar. Also, the bottom part of my pint had an air bubble, so it was hollow. Overall very disappointing. I'll just stick to the B&J's regular cookie dough ice cream!\n",
            "I was soooooo excited to try this!! Then I did and immediately wished I got something else. The ice cream was good but the supposed cookie dough core was like eating brown sugar and chocolate chips. It was so nasty that I ate around it. Truly disappointed....I have never been let down before so I guess there is a first time for everything.\n",
            "I've never gotten a cookie dough core pint from Ben and Jerry's, but I'll never buy this again. I was expecting it to look the way the caramel core does when you open it, but instead there is such little cookie dough it would've been better to just get a regular cookie dough or half baked pint. If I'm going to spend $5 for a pint, I would at least like to get what is advertised. The same happened with my boyfriend's brownie batter core so this is not just a one time thing, but a consistent problem.\n",
            "I have been waiting for this to come out at my grocery store. The minute I could buy it I got it. I was really upset. Like many others have said the cookie dough core is sandy and grainy. I was thinking it was going to be like the cookie dough in the normal ice cream. Really upset about this.\n",
            "I am a loyal fan and this is the one and only flavor I have thrown away. The pictures make it look amazing and I understand it’s for marketing so variation is expected. That being said the “core” is almost non existent. The bottom half of the ice cream had absolutely no core. The top half had a small chunk. The cookie dough that I did get was grainy and had a funky taste. It wasn’t cookie dough that’s for sure. The ice cream itself was creamy and had a nice flavor but I’m so disappointed that this was such a flop.\n",
            "Not at all like non core cookie dough which is soft and tastes really good. The core tastes terrible and has a very hard grainy texture. Not good!\n",
            "This is the first time I haven't been able to finish a pint of Ben & Jerry's. Tried it and threw the rest away! I love cookie dough ice cream and thought this would be great, only to be extremely disappointed! The vanilla ice cream is almost tasteless, and the cookie dough \"core\" was absolutely gross. It had none of the flavors I would expect from cookie dough, basically just sugar with a few chocolate chips. Plus, the core was half the size of the other flavors! This flavor is a HUGE miss, save yourself the trouble and try the sugar cookie core flavor instead!\n",
            "My order of these new pints was delivered yesterday from the Ben and Jerry’s online store and last night was Chocolate Chip Cookie dough core. it’s awesome! The ice cream really does taste like cookie milk. I’ve never had anything like it; so yummy. but the star is the core. PERFECT texture and EXCELLENT flavor. The ice cream and the core together are a match made in heaven. It’s sublime. I hope this stays for a long time.\n",
            "I wait and waited for this to be available at my local store. Yuck. HARD, grainy, gritty cookie dough core. This is nothing like cookie dough. Don't be fooled the cookie dough center is SMALL. I'm a Ben & Jerry's fan, but you lost me here. So disappointed in my purchase.\n",
            "I brought this Ice cream because I love the ben and jerry’s cookie dough, so I thought more or the goodness cookies dough. WRONG the cookie dough is not in the middle( which is not a big of a deal) and the cookie dough is gritty and taste like sugar it’s horrible. The reason it has a 3 stars is because the cookie milk ice cream is to die for, it’s just the cookie do is disgusting. This best thing if you do get this is eat around the cookie dough core\n",
            "I literally stalked the grocery stores for this to come out and was so excited to snag it. Super disappointed. I’m a huge fan of B&J and cookie dough ice cream but this was terrible. Agree with other reviewers, the cookie dough was grainy and gritty. I didn’t want to throw it out so I kept eating it, but it took me well over 2 weeks to finish a pint. For context, I’m lucky if a pint lasts three days.\n",
            "I bout the NEW COOKIE DOUGH CORE. Was not good at all when I think of cookie dough it’s soft creamy just like normal cookie dough. It’s like eating sand very big disappointment honestly and I ben&jerrys. Work on this please!\n",
            "Bought this today and was so disappointed! Cookie dough is nothing like in the reg chocolate chip cookie dough. I thought at first maybe it was supposed to have some kind of swirl in it and never found the cookie dough core like you find with the brownie batter version! It’s awful esp if you thunk your getting the cookie dough like in the reg or the bites. I would give it one star but it won’t let me.\n",
            "I bought the Cookie Dough Core ice cream because I usually love chocolate chip cookie dough. While the ice cream itself was delicious ( the only reason I didn't give this 1 star), I was completely disappointed by the cookie dough core part. It was gritty and just not good. I ended up eating around it and don't even want to bother with the rest of the pint. No good!\n",
            "I gave this product a 3 just because I like cookie dough. I felt like this was no different than the regular chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. I would have liked to see more cookie dough, like maybe a chocolate chip cookie dough with a cookie dough core, maybe a half chocolate half vanilla.. I think then that would have made more sense. All the other core pint flavors are more special and different this one was boring and basic... not my favorite unfortunately.\n",
            "I bought the cookie dough core and the cookie dough was crumbly when I tried to scoop it out. It was hard, had a grainy texture and didn't taste very good at all,nothing like the cookie dough in the half baked. The icecream part was good though\n",
            "my brother picked this up on accident instead of the regular one. This was horrible. Absolutely the worst thing I’ve tasted in my life. Grainy dry sand as “dough”. Ice cream below par. Horrible choice all around. I’ll never get that 7$ back. ROBBERY!\n",
            "I was so so excited to try this because I love cookie dough ice cream. On one hand I want to give this product five stars because the ice cream was delicious and I personally loved the cookie dough in the middle. On the other hand I want to give it one star because it was not what I was expecting and I was still disappointed. I was really hoping for a bigger cookie dough core and I expected for there to still be chunks of cookie dough in the ice cream portion. I was hoping that this new product would finally be ice cream stuffed with cookie dough that I’ve been waiting for.\n",
            "Totally disappointed in this flavor. I love Ben & Jerry’s cookie dough. But the cookie dough core was terrible. First of all the core was more like a cone getting smaller the more you dug down and it didn’t go all the way down to the bottom of the pint. And the cookie dough itself was terrible it was grainy and didn’t have the same taste the cookies dough usually has. It tasted like it was heavy on brown sugar or something. It just wasn’t right. Anyway I was sorely disappointed.\n",
            "This is really good ice cream and I've had a few. However they need to put more cookie dough in the core. There is never enough. Never goes to the bottom of the carton or very little amount\n",
            "I love Cookie Dough Core but so disappointing when you eat one and it has an inch of core. This was my third time buying one like the one seen in the photo.\n",
            "I just bought this today and when I opened it the cookie dough wasn’t even in the middle and there was barely any\n",
            "We love all Ben and Jerry's ice cream. Any with cookie dough are our favorite. We were so excited to hear about this new flavor, however once we tried it we were disappointed that the core isn't cookie dough at all, but rather more like a cookie butter. It's sugary and not doughy. This was a disappointment, however it still taste good. The cookie dough ice cream is better. In addition, the dough part is not even in the middle like the photos nor does it go all the way through. Suggestion would be to have a core made out of cookie dough bites piled in the middle.\n",
            "Nope, Nope, Nope! You cannot fool a cookie dough expert. I had my heart set on this having a REAL cookie dough core. Much to my dismay, the core was nothing like the cookie dough in your other ice creams. :(\n",
            "I bought this Yesterday and immediately dug into it once I was finish eating my food, I had read some views about this before and notice they were pretty awful so I decided to never buy this until the reviews change. Well yesterday, I asked my mom could she buy me any Ben and Jerry’s I’ve Cream that had cookie dough in it and this is what she brought me, my immediate reaction was “oh no.” But hey, I didn’t mind trying it! Fast forward to when I opened the pint, there was cookie dough in the center and pretty thick(obviously you can see it in the picture) and was like, oh wow! So I decided to eat the ice cream first and I noticed it really tasted like a cookie had been soaked in some milk for about three minutes, and I was shocked because it tasted amazing! I got to the dough and remembered how one person stated it had a grainy texture, so I dug in and it did, but it didn’t really bother me THAT MUCH, it still tasted a bit like cookie dough, so I just scooped some of the dough and icecream together and that kind of made it better, I also remembered how some people said there was barely any in there but mine was PACKED with dough and it was so much that in some areas, the dough was showing more than the icecream itself! I would totally buy this again and put some of their cookie dough bites inside to make the ultimate cookie dough core flavor there is! 4/5 rating!\n",
            "After a month of waiting for this flavor, it didn't quite meet my expectations. The cookie dough core, which was supposed to be the highlight, was disappointing. The texture is too grainy while the flavor tastes off. On top of that, the core wasn't spread evenly from the top to bottom of the pint I tried.\n",
            "Now let me just say that chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream is my favorite B&J flavor. I bought this new flavor about a week ago thinking it would be great. How can you go wrong with a choc chip cookie dough core I thought. Boy was I wrong. I took one bite of that cookie dough core, and went \"Blech!\" The ice cream with chocolate bits was good. That was it. What recipe they used to make this cookie dough core is not even close to the taste or consistency of the classic original. The taste is vile. I would not waste your time buying this flavor.\n",
            "If you love the cookie dough from the regular ice cream don't buy this! I don't think I've ever been this disappointed in a Ben and Jerry's flavor. The cookie dough they use for the core is completely different in the worse ways. It's mushy and taste like garbage. It's salty and weird tasting. I like lots of different kinds of cookie dough. I don't think I've ever tasted any kind of cookie dough that I've hated before. Until now. How did this pass taste testing? Good thing there was hardly any core anyway so I can still eat the ice cream part.\n",
            "Kept an eye out for this in the store as soon as I heard it was coming out and bought the first one I could find. The ice cream flavor was good and the fudge chips added much needed interest to the pint. The cookie dough was delicious, although there wasn't enough of it. The core was off center and didn't go all the way to the bottom of the pint. Could be remedied by adding cookie dough chunks to the ice cream or increasing the size/quality of the core.\n",
            "Like most other reviewers i found the core terrible. Bad texture and bad taste.\n",
            "I bought this with so much excitement, when I took that first bite into the core, yuck! The cookie dough is just straight sugar, when you chew it your feel the grinds on your teeth. I love the chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and that is the cookie dough I expected the core to be filled with and boy was I wrong! Do not purchase this kind, you will just end up throwing it away like I did\n",
            "I was really disappointed with the cookie dough in the core. It was dry and crumbly, not creamy and doughy like the regular CCCD. It also has an off flavor...like they spilled the vanilla when making this crusty old dough. The ice cream part was decent. I saw somebody else noted a big air bubble at the bottom. I'm had the same experience. I do not recommend and will not purchase again.\n",
            "My family bought this on accident thinking it was the regular cookie dough recipe. I tried it anyways and it was way too sweet. The cookie milk was not a smart move, there was nothing to offset the sweetness of the cookie dough. Cookie dough with just vanilla is much better in my opinion. Also, the cookie dough was very grainy and mostly tasted like straight up sugar.\n",
            "The core is very gritty and tastes odd on its own, but tastes good with the ice cream. The sugar in the cookie dough wasn’t beaten long enough to get rid of the graininess and could’ve been so much better. The base is unique and creamy and the chocolate flakes are solid, though I wish there were more of them. Overall, a bit underwhelming with a disappointing core.\n",
            "I loooove cookie dough ice cream. When I saw the core on the package I was like “heck yes! Extra cookie dough!” Psych! There’s like NONE and it’s impossible to scoop out. Then, the cookie dough itself is disgusting! It tastes like how I imagine literal fish food would. I absolutely hate it and I genuinely think it was a waste of my money.\n",
            "I was so excited to try this as I love cookie dough. Literally went to multiple different grocery stores all over NYC for weeks to find this. What a let down. The cookie dough core is not good. Very crumbly and grainy, like sand is in it. No where near the creaminess and taste of cookie dough used in Tonight Dough, Half Baked or the regular Cookie dough. Ice Cream was good at least. If you're a fan of cookie dough, skip this and hopefully they revisit the recipe.\n",
            "I’m so sad I wasted $12 on this ice cream, I am in Australia and I was so excited to try this and i am so let down I didn’t even eat it. The cookie dough is grainy and tastes nothing like the cookie dough that’s in the rest of the flavours, and the “fudge” pieces are just dark chocolate. Do not waste your money!\n",
            "One of my favorite flavors is the cookie dough. Expectations were highly disappointed when the same cookie dough recipe was not in this cookie dough core flavor. I’m not even sure it’s cookie dough. I think it’s pure brown sugar. Will not buy this flavor again unless they put the original cookie dough in it!\n",
            "Im eating this flavor as we speak and the other reviews are right! Tastes NOTHING like the cookie doigh in the other flavors. It has a sandy, gritty texture like chewing on sugar. Im going to finish it though because the rest of it is alright. But yeah i’ll just stick to my favorite one , Half Baked!!!\n",
            "I've bought this a few different times, each time hoping it would be better than the last. I kept thinking \"okay, I must have had bad luck and gotten a bad batch\". Unfortunately after buying approximately 5 to 6 pints, I've come to the conclusion that this just isn't good in any way. The \"cookie milk\" ice cream just tastes like regular old vanilla but with a slightly weird taste and extremely weird aftertaste. The \"cookie dough\" core (which, in my opinion, is supposed to be the best part and main attraction) was horrible! Did NOT taste like cookie dough AT ALL! Even the texture was so, soooooo off! Just like all the other reviews say - TASTES LIKE SWEETENED SAND! Now don't get my wrong - I am usually a HUGE fan of B&J's - however this particular flavor just is completely so far off from the quality I've come to know and love, and expect from this brand. This could have been an amazing and wonderful flavor but unfortunately this missed the mark. Extremely dissappointed, B&J's!! Do better!!\n",
            "Was so excited to try this because I love Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. I experienced disappointment at the first bite. The Cookie Chip Dough Core was like eating super gritty sugar sand. I am hoping Ben & Jerry will switch and use their original Cookie Dough recipe in this new \"core\" ice cream.\n",
            "The first flavor I've been disappointed with. The \"cookie dough\" core has the texture of brown sugar. When you chew it you can feel the sugar crystals. Its not the same as the cookie dough balls in the regular cookie dough pint. I did still polish off the pint though since the ice cream is good\n",
            "The ratio of cookie dough to ice cream is off. By the time you get to the bottom of the pint, all that's left is the vanilla ice cream with little chocolate bits. You're better off getting chocolate chip cookie dough which is more consistent and has a better cookie dough-to-ice cream ratio.\n",
            "I just had this ice cream a hour ago, the actually ice is not bad at all but the cookie dough just ruined it for me. It tasted so gritty , I thought maybe I should mix it up and it made it even worse. I ended up scooping as much of the cookie dough out that I could. Smh\n",
            "The ice cream part is so good!! I was so excited to try this, my favorite Ben and Jerry’s flavor is half baked mostly because of the cookie dough haha. So a COOKIE DOUGH CORE I was pumped. I was so so disappointed it tasted like nothing honestly, just pure sugar and very very grainy. If they would have replicated the regular cookie dough balls into the core it could’ve been fantastic, but this just isn’t good I really wish it was :/\n",
            "Listen to the bad reviews. the core does not taste like their regular cookie dough. It tastes grainy, like brown sugar. And the rest of it is just chocolate chip ice cream. So nothing exciting. The wake and bake ice cream core was the same. Super grainy.\n",
            "The cookie milk ice cream was the only thing I liked about the product. As a cookie dough lover, I was very disappointed in the cookie dough core. It tasted nothing like cookie dough, just grainy like sugar. I’ll stick with other cookie dough varieties.\n",
            "I'm not the hugest fan of cookie dough in ice cream, so I'm going to be honest I ate around the cookie dough core and OH MAN the cookie milk flavored ice cream is probably the yummiest ice cream flavor I've ever had! YUM\n",
            "I love the cookie milk ice cream. I wish they would use this as the base for more flavors. The chocolate chips are also delicious and I’ve always had plenty of cookie dough in my pints. This flavor is the best!\n",
            "AWFUL. I’m a huge fan of Ben & Jerrys cookie dough and this was such a disappointment. The cookie dough core crumbles and is as hard as a rock. It’s grainy and tastes terrible, too.\n",
            "I bought this for the cookie dough core and there is no cookie dough core.. this is the second pint of \"core\" I've cream that didn't even have a core. I'm really disappointed.\n",
            "Ice cream tasted like artificial sweeteners and the core was nothing like cookie dough in taste or texture. Was very disappointed, totally not worth the price (or calories)\n",
            "The cookie dough core taste terrible, like it has some kind of sweeteners in it. the after taste lingers like sour milk...don't buy this!\n",
            "The ice cream is nice but could use something besides just chips. The core is grainy and sugary totally unlike the regular cookie dough.\n",
            "I was looking forward to trying this, but it was a let down. The ice cream was decent, but the cookie dough core was grainy and sad.\n",
            "I was excited to get Ben&Jerrys ice cream after a long time. I expected it to be another amazing experience. I brought this Pint of I cream only to find that the cookie dough core was small, it wasn’t EVEN A CORE! It was off to the side, fell apart. It’s a whole scam idk why they even continue to sell this Ice cream in this condition. I should have checked the reviews. Y’all obviously don’t pay attention to customer reviews cause you would notice this is unacceptable. Smh\n",
            "This is terrible! The cookie dough core is basically brown sugar with chocolate. I wish I could get my money back.\n",
            "I love every ice cream they put out. I particularly love this flavor and I recommend it to everyone.\n",
            "I’m pretty sure there is less cookie dough in throw then there is in the regular one\n",
            "Tried this for the first time and the other reviews summarized it perfectly.\n",
            "I regularly purchace and enjoy the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream so I thought I'd try the new Core version that had just arrived in NZ. What a big mistake, it is disgusting. It does not taste the same and the cookie dough is awful, its grainy and basically inedible. I deeply regret straying away from the normal version and strongly recommend people read and heed the advice of the majority of other reviews here and avoid this strange disastrous flavour!\n",
            "I took it upon myself to try every new flavor with chocolate in it and rate it. You’re welcome. I find the cookie dough core so sweet. IMHO the ice cream base should be vanilla. In addition, the cookie dough core should either have salted butter in it or add a little salt to mimic butter. That would cut the sweetness. Do not salted caramel or chocolate sea salt, YUCK! Anyway, just my take on it. Also, please bring back Dublin Mudslide! It was my favorite.\n",
            "Its a dream come true. Just when I thought it couldn't get better, there's more cookie dough than before. Continue to make the core as large as possible- never short change the core.\n",
            "I've had this a few times now and there's plenty of cookie dough in the pints I've had. I love that I don't have to go searching for the dough in these pints!\n",
            "My only issue is it's not sold at my local Giant Eagle, which has B&J Core pints but there's not even a spot on their shelf for the chocolate chip cookie dough core flavor. I only get it when I'm at my mom's lol.\n",
            "My all-time favorite ice cream is, hands down, original cookie dough by Ben and Jerry's. So I was thrilled to see they had a core version featuring cookie dough as its magical center. Boy was I disappointed to taste the grainy, overly sugary, poor substitute they chose to use in place of their original cookie dough recipe. Ben and Jerry, please rework this product and try using your original winner of a recipe for the cookie dough core!\n",
            "I bought this today at my local HEB, and thought I would try it since I love the chocolate chip cookie dough, honestly because I love cookie dough, but the cookie dough in this ice cream is grainy. It is hard to scoop because of the grainy texture, making it hard to actually enjoy the ice cream. The ice cream itself is amazing, but what’s the point of buying chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, if you don’t enjoy the cookie dough.\n",
            "I'm sick and all I wanted was cookie dough ice cream. I couldn't find the classic that I could always count on, so I went with this. The core was a crumbly texture and it tasted like I was eating clumps of brown sugar. The ice cream flavor just tasted like milk with unsweetened chocolate and I am not a fan of solid milk. I recomend bringing back the original cookie dough ice cream. :( Seriously so sad and disappointed.\n",
            "My husband loves all ice cream. But not this one. I gave it to him after I decided I couldn't eat it. We both agree the ice cream tastes like rice pudding with a lot of water and the cookie dough core does not taste anywhere near as delicious as Ben and Jerry's cookie dough. We haven't had a bad Ben & Jerry's flavor until this one! If you're craving cookie dough, go with any of their other cookie dough varieties.\n",
            "I bought this because the store i went to didn’t have my favorite chocolate chip cookie dough pint. I figured it may be just as good since it still is cookie dough. I was wrong and extremely disappointed. The core was crispy and broke every time I tried to scoop it. The flavor was more like toasted piece of bread than cookie. I will stick with the original chocolate chip cookie dough which has never let me down.\n",
            "I loved the flavor of the cookie milk ice cream! I actually came to the website to see if any other flavors had that type of ice cream. Like many other reviewers I’m very disappointed by the cookie dough core. I was expecting it to be like the cookie dough ice cream but instead it was very gritty. I’m very torn on if I’d get this flavor again. I loved the ice cream flavor but really didn’t care for the “core”\n",
            "Bought this instead of my regular go tos (half baked or brownie batter core) since it was new! I am so disappointed because the cookie dough actually does just taste like brown sugar and is gritty. I ended up here on the reviews because I googled to make sure it wasn’t just my taste buds or that there was something wrong with my purchase. Sure enough others have posted the same thing :(\n",
            "This ice cream is AMAZING. The flavor of the ice cream is extremely light and is loaded with chocolate chips. The core itself has a gritty texture but tastes almost identical to raw cookie dough.\n",
            "This was a perfect example of a marketing bumble. If I get a spoonful of ice cream I want each bite to have a little bit of goodness in it. I shouldn’t have to go digging for it. The “core” is nothing but a grainy sugar that is flavoured with something that vaguely represents dough. I can actually imagine the assembly line pumping out this stuff. Soooo disappointing.\n",
            "You have to try the ice cream in this one... worth it!\n",
            "I love the texture of the cookie core; it’s soft enough to eat without difficulty. The taste is AMAZING...the cookie milk ice cream is spot on.\n",
            "I bought the cookie dough core, and I loved the fact that there was dough all the way down to the bottom, however not all of them are the same. It seems like not enough dough to be a core of the ice cream and it’s sometimes a very thin core as well. Cookie dough ice cream is something we crave.. I would assume a product came out sooner than later that does that.\n",
            "I saw the ad and went to the grocery store that night to buy some. I ate around the cookie dough core bc it was so grainy and sugary and not anything like the cookie dough in the other ice creams that it wasn’t even worth it. Let’s be honest - there’s so many calories in these pints that if I’m going to eat it I need to love it and this was way below par\n",
            "Perfection in every dreamy creamy cookie dough-y bite!\n",
            "I bought this pint despite the reviews because I was excited to try it for myself. All the reviews are accurate though. The ice cream itself is delicious! But the cookie dough core is not good at all. It has an almost fruity taste to it and is extremely gritty in texture. It's nothing like their normal cookie dough. Definitely won't be buying again.\n",
            "I was so excited for this ice cream as chocolate chip cookie dough it my favorite..I was expecting a core of cookie dough with the same taste and texture of the bits in the regular ice cream. Instead it is gritty and doesn't even taste like cookie dough. I am extremely dissatisfied. Even my 11 year old son thinks it's terrible. Please reformulate!\n",
            "Ben and Jerry's Ice cream has been my favorite since I was a little kid, however...this one the textures were off. The cookie dough was grainy and tasted like flour or another ingredient was missing. The ice cream was icey in texture, not creamy. I had to double check I didn't get a frozen yogurt version. Wondering if the batch was off?\n",
            "i tried this thinking that the cookie dough would be like the chunks in half baked. it was not. it was very gritty and it almost had a liquor flavor. i hated it. although it did not taste good, the core went all the way to the bottom. the ice cream was great though. that is the only reason why this is getting 2 stars instead of one.\n",
            "Everyone expects a core of cookie dough throughout, when buying it. Unfortunately, you only get a small gob in the middle. Pretty sure you get more (quality and quantity) from the regular cookie dough flavor than this core flavor.\n",
            "The only reason why it didn't get a 1 star was because the cookie milk ice cream was pretty tasty.\n",
            "This was the first time I was ever disappointed by a Ben and Jerry’s pint. The milk and cookies flavor icecream was just rather plain and very sugary. I wish there was more texture going on. And the core just tasted like a ball of sugar. It was anything I couldn’t eat, but it also wasn’t anything I was enjoying eating.\n",
            "I was expecting to be overwhelmed with cookie dough deliciousness however I am left wondering what went wrong. There was no “core” and really no cookie dough. The ice cream in my opinion is ok but the lack of cookie dough was super disappointing. There is way more dough in the original. My advice skip this one.\n",
            "I tried this thinking it would be as good as regular cookie dough. I was highly disappointed. The \"core\" was not anything like the regular cookie dough. It was very grainy and sugary. Also, the pint was not fully filled. There was an empty space about 2/3 the way down. I will not buy this product again.\n",
            "I was soooo thrilled that it would be a core of the same cookie dough they use in Half Baked and the Tonight Dough. But it really just tasted like granulated brown sugar. I’m soooo sad about that. Because their regular chocolate chip cookie dough is the best you can find. Oh man I hope the replace it.\n",
            "I was so excited to try this ice cream since cookie dough ice cream is my favorite. I was very disappointed in the cookie dough \"core\" it was very chalky and almost sand like. The flavor of cookie dough was not there at all. And the core was more of a sliver. Really hoped this would have been better.\n",
            "I bought this thinking that it would be the same cookie dough as what's in their regular ice cream that I like but this cookie dough tastes like watery sand. I would love to see this product made with the same cookie dough in the core as what's in the regular chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.\n",
            "This had great potential - you guys should have stuck to your regular cookie dough... no cookie dough lover would enjoy this... the \"dough\" core is gritty, the texture is horrible, its like eating sand in your ice cream. nasty. I love ben and jerrys but this is a big let down remake the recipe!!!\n",
            "I eat a lot of Ben and Jerry's, like a lot. And I was so stoked to see this flavor because I love the cookie dough in your other ice creams. Unfortunately mine was as everyone else described. The cookie dough was too runny, and tasted like melted butter. The ice cream itself was great as always.\n",
            "I bought this since there was no choc chip cookie dough in stock and figured it would be similar. The dough is like eating unprocessed brown sugar, grainy and way too sweet. The ice cream is fine, but I still threw it all away because the dough is so bad. DO NOT BUY THIS FLAVOR, EEEEEKKKKK!!\n",
            "I’m living for the cookie milk ice cream. It is sooooo goood and I need more of it asap. It got me through finals too\n",
            "The ice cream is the best part. Tastes like cookies and cream. Delicious! But the core...tastes nothing like their regular cookie dough. I can’t find the words to describe the taste but it is not good and leaves a weird aftertaste. Exactly like the other reviews.....texture is like wet sand.\n",
            "I wanted to try the core ice cream so bad so even though it wasn’t on sale I went ahead and bought it cause it looked soooooo good, honestly it’s the most nastiest ice cream I’ve ever tried!!! The core has such a weird texture to it, and taste nothing like cookie dough, super disappointed\n",
            "This really shoulda been flippin amazing. The icecream and fudge chips are great but the texture of the core does knock it down a few pegs. If it had the texture of the cookie dough used in the regular chocolate chip cookie dough/half baked it would be amazing. Overall I'd say 2.8 outta 5\n",
            "Definitely one of my most favourite ice cream flavours just wish there was more Cookie Dough in it!!!\n",
            "I just picked this up and was excited to have more cookie dough... But I almost couldn't find any. I had three small little spots of cookie dough and it was very grainy, not like the cookie dough in the original cookie dough ice cream. Will NOT be buying this one again. Wasted my money\n",
            "Cookie dough ice cream is my favorite. While the flavor is fine, I don’t enjoy the texture of the cookie dough core. It’s almost just like flavored sugar, and doesn’t really provide the cookie dough feel. Overall, it’s not bad, I was just craving cookie dough and this missed the mark.\n",
            "I have been anxiously waiting for this flavor to hit stores near me, and I finally found it today. Was soooo excited to try it out! However, was extremely disappointed when the “cookie dough” core didn’t even taste like cookie dough! Not even close on texture or flavor unfortunately.\n",
            "I was so excited to try this as I have such a love for cookie dough and love the globs of cookie dough in the normal cookie dough ice cream. It was such a disappointment though, the ice cream part was good but the cookie dough core was incredibly grainy and had an off flavor.\n",
            "I really love this one and buy it often. I have never experienced a “tiny” amount of cookie dough like many of the reviews state. However, I would give 5 stars if there were also some cookie dough pieces in the vanilla sides or chocolate chip cookies or something like that\n",
            "I bought this a week ago at Walmart Neighborhood Market and I was so excited to try it. But then the moment came that I did and it was terrible! There hardly any cookie dough pieces and the core was grainy and gross. Do not buy this flavor it is the worst I’ve ever had.\n",
            "My and my family loves Ben and Gerry ice cream 5 star ice cream\n",
            "got this Sunday and was so excited to try it, as my local store was out of the kind my boyfriend likes (chubby hubby) and it was like eating brown sugar bombs. there was no cookie dough. maybe the ice cream box got mixed up when it was being packaged. I was NOT a fan\n",
            "I bought this flavor and was really excited about the cookie dough core but when I bought it the cookie dough wasn’t very good, it was hard and difficult to scoopand there wasn’t enough of it, not to mention the actual cookie milk ice cream didn’t taste like much\n",
            "It is disappointing, because the actual ice cream is quite delicious! However, the cookie dough itself is as if they forgot to add flour; it's like a heavy sugar stick. If it were the same dough from the cookie dough ice cream, this ice cream would EASILY be 5/5!\n",
            "The cookie dough core is a grainy sugar mess! The ice cream itself is also a huge letdown. It tastes nothing like the delicious chocolate chip ice cream in the usual cookie dough flavor. I have no desire to finish the carton, and I’ll never purchase it again.\n",
            "I bought this a couple days ago and it is the best ice cream I have ever purchased. Tastes\n",
            "EXACTLY like chocolate chip cookies dipped in milk! I hope this flavor is never discontinued!! I plan on purchasing all the remaining ones at my local grocery store!!\n",
            "Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough used to be my FAVORITE B&J ice cream. I just tried the NEW Cookie Dough Core. The Cookie Dough in the new version has a strange taste and texture (not strange good). Please bring back the previous product. Pretty please.\n",
            "This was disgusting. I expected the cookie dough from the normal ice cream or half baked and what I got was a gritty mess. The ice cream wasn’t terrible but the cookie dough solidified my feelings. Skip this. Get the normal cookie dough instead.\n",
            "At first I thought I had a bad batch but after seeing other reviews it sounds like I’m not the only one. The cookie dough core is like eating sweet sand. The ice cream was great as always but something is very off with the cookie dough recipe\n",
            "Fantastic game good graphics good music own good way to its addictive gameplay and\n",
            "I love the chocolate chunk and vanilla ice cream.  Unfortunately I cannot find vanilla chocolate chunk anymore, I also like chunky monkey, but the the big chunks of dark chocolate in vanilla were the best!! This is the next best thing!!!\n",
            "I was so excited for this to come out! Ben & Jerry's cookie dough is my favorite. However, the cookie dough core was just a gritty disappointment. The cookie dough core is so grainy and sand-like. I hope they reformulate and try again!\n",
            "I hope this isn't going to replace the regular chocolate chip cookie dough. It's more like a container of chocolate chip with hardly any cookie dough. The cookie dough doesn't even taste the same. I won't be buying this again\n",
            "I bought this 4 days ago because I couldn’t find my regular chocolate chip cookie dough. Not only does the cookie dough recipe taste different but so does the ice cream I’m so disappointed. I will be going back to Hagen Diaz.\n",
            "This is my new least fave, even worse than Schweitzer’s Balls. The ice cream doesn’t have much flavor, just sweet. The core is puny: maybe 2-3 bites. The flavor of the core is ok (the only redeeming feature) but grainy\n",
            "A big letdown. The cookie dough was completely different than you would find in the non-core offering - to the point that I almost wondered if something was wrong with it. The ice cream portion was very tasty.\n",
            "The cookie dough itself is sandy ans grainy, it has an odd taste I can't really lay my finger on. But if you eat enough of the ice cream with the core it balances out a lot better and isn't as noticeable.\n",
            "I bought this flavor on 10/15/19. I love cookies and ice cream so I was excited to try this cookie dough center. I was expecting an actual cookie dough texture but really it’s just grainy and sugar like.\n",
            "Should have read the reviews first. I don’t even mind the grainy texture of the cookie dough. But it tastes horrible! Not like cookie dough at all. This could have been amazing. Super disappointed.\n",
            "This ice cream tastes cheap and gross. I usually love all their stuff but this one was just nasty. The \"icecream\" tasted like they just froze a cup of milk and the cookie dough was grainy and crumbly.\n",
            "the cookie milk ice cream is okay, chocolate chips are chocolate chips...but wow that cookie dough core is gross. so horribly grainy and not a good flavor. they should really offer people a refund\n",
            "The ice cream flavor itself was delicious but the chocolate chips were gross they need to be milk chocolate the core was tasty but the texture was very grainy needs to be cooked a little bit more\n",
            "I bought one because i love cookie dough. Ben and Jerry's is my favorite icecream after one bite I was so disappointed! The texture of it was the worst I couldn't eat I throw it in the trash.\n",
            "The cookie dough core tasted more like a scoop of brown sugar with some chip chunks in it. I’m sorry but there was nothing cookie dough about it. Totally disappointed and a waste of money.\n",
            "The ice cream favor was good but the cookie dough itself didn't taste like cookie dough had grainy like texture due to too much sugar. Not what I expected out of Ben and Jerry's\n",
            "This is the ice cream everyone dreams, but alas, a dream it will remain. The “cookie dough” is basically just brown sugar, about the size of dime throughout. Pass this one up!\n",
            "The cookie dough was grainy and there was less than any other flavor containing cookie dough. The ice cream was great but I was expecting an amazing cookie dough core.\n",
            "I was excited to try this ice cream. I was very disappointed. The cookie dough “core” was tiny. I think I get more cookie dough in regular chocolate chip cookie dough.\n",
            "This pint tastes great but feels like it has way less cookie dough than the regular one. I waited months for this and was really disappointment.\n",
            "ice cream is good but the cookie dough taste like brown sugar and butter . nothing like cookie dough it’s like sand dissolving on your tongue\n",
            "Tastes like cookie dough, especially good if you get a mix of the dough and the icecream compared to just eating straight at the dough. 8/10\n",
            "My daughter tried this one and says the only thing this: More Cookie Dough\". Keep it up with the flavors. They are simply delicious!!!\n",
            "There was not nearly enough cookie dough in the core, I was disapointed it did not even reach the bottom of the pint.\n",
            "The core is grainy, cumbly, and nothing like the dough balls in regular cookie dough. :( Please rework the core!\n",
            "The ice cream itself tastes bland and watered down, the cookie core is like sand it's a major disappointment....\n",
            "The core was a terrible texture, and barely had any flavor. Super grainy. Back to the regular cookie dough....\n",
            "After being spoiled by chocolate chip cookie dough, my expectations were too high. Disappointed.\n",
            "Ben and Jerrys fan since they started. This one falls way short. Minimal core, nothing special.\n",
            "This is awesome! Its not grainy like the others with the cookie dough\n",
            "This was just a core of grainy sugar. Yuck never buying this again\n",
            "How did you guys mess this up? It could have been so good.\n",
            "The cookie dough sucked.i repeat The cookie dough sucked.\n",
            "There was nothing epic about be the cookie dough core.\n",
            "Was no cookie dough at all. Ripoff. So enraged ...\n",
            "I am a loyal Ben and Jerry's customer and most of their flavors are amazing and when I saw this in the store I was so excited to try it. But I am beyond disappointed in this. First I will say that the cookie milk ice cream part is DELICIOUS. I wouldn't change anything about the cookie milk ice cream. However, I was looking forward to a big center of that same delicious cookie dough that's in the other pints of ice cream (like the half baked). But instead, after digging through all the cookie milk ice cream I found a tiny little section of cookie dough, not even a core. Just a chunk on the side of cookie dough that isn't even actual cookie dough. It LITERALLY tastes like sugary sand and has a grainy texture. Nothing like the cookie dough I always enjoy in the other flavors.\n",
            "Ummm this is the best thing I've ever eaten (probably). I've been silently waiting for cookie dough core Ben & Jerry's and this one outdid any expectations I had. All of the flavors (almond, cherry, sugar cookie, shortbread) taste like happiness on a pink cloud of soft fatty calorie heaven. Would definitely eat an entire pint in one sitting to cope with my depressed emotions again. Hoping to also eat part of a pint in one sitting while I'm happy to experience the flavors in a different mood so I will update when that happens. (Spoiler alert: still going to be 5 star rating.)\n",
            "This is great! The cherry/cherry reminds me of Cherry Garcia and the sweet cream almond is really pleasant. I was afraid the almond would be too far forward but it’s actually very well balanced. But of course, as always, the core is the star of this pint. I had to resist the urge to pry out the entire core and eat it all at once. It’s really delicious! Mine was pretty firm but it had just come out of the deep freeze so that’s understandable. I can’t wait to buy another of these.\n",
            "Now onto my last one; the wake no-bake.\n",
            "I have been sampling my way through the cores, and this one has absolutely been my favorite. Though I like the core itself, for me it's the ice creams and chunks that make it. I do love almond flavor, and this is done perfectly. At first glance, I thought that cookie dough/cherries/cherry ice cream/shortbread/sweet cream almond ice cream was going to be too over-the-top, but everything comes together perfectly. There's not a flavor or texture I'd leave out. We have a winner!\n",
            "I have purchased almost 10 pints of this since discovering it. Literally the best ice cream I have ever had! Never stop making it!\n",
            "I was intitially hesistant about this because I’m not a huge cherry fan. I do however love sugar cookies (and especially the dough). When I finally found it in a store I wasn’t sure what to expect but it was seriously amazing! I love the almond-y flavor it has to it and it actually works quite well with the cherry. Will definitely be repurchasing once this pint is gone!\n",
            "This ice cream tastes like Tortoni, one of my favorite desserts, only it’s amped up to 11. I hope they never stop making this.\n",
            "Always hesitant about branching out and trying a new flavor but I think I just found my new favorite...absolutely amazing\n",
            "Bought it on a whim, and now I find myself craving this new amazing flavor!! The almond, and cherry goes so perfect together.. and the sugar cookie actually tastes like the real thing! You won’t be disappointed. I hope they keep this one around for a while.\n",
            "I’ve eaten a lot of ice cream over my nearly six decades of life, and have been a Cherry Garcia fanatic for years. I never dreamed that Ben and Jerry’s would create a better flavor. I am happy to say I was wrong. Sweet Like Sugar beats out Cherry Garcia by a nose.\n",
            "Please don't EVER stop making this! The combo of flavors and textures is perfect: the touch of almond in the sweet cream on the one side and the nostalgic Cherry Garcia on the other, all tied together by the most decadent sugar cookie dough core... seriously. It can't be beat. It tastes like a bunch of classic holiday flavors combined!\n",
            "Wow. I bought this as I quickly saw something new on my way out the store and I’m glad I did. I’m not a huge chocolate fan so it’s so nice to get a non chocolate flavor!! Both “sides” are great. The cherry side is similar to a non chocolate cherry Garcia and the sweet cream side is a delightful lightly almond flavor. Love this flavor.\n",
            "This is the kind of ice cream they eat in heaven. Jumping to the top of my favorite flavor list.\n",
            "I bought this about a year ago, leading up to that I had been looking for it tirelessly. Once I finally got my hands on it.... it did not disappoint! This is the most delicious ice cream ever, the almond flavor is spot on and the cherry side is loaded with luscious, large cherries. The sugar cookie dough core is wow, just wow. I love the texture of grainy sugar in a sugar cookie and this hit it right on the nail. I will definitely be repurchasing this item till the end of time!\n",
            "I’m usually not motivated to leave feedback, but after tasting this ice cream, I just had to post. It is amazing! Very seldom do you taste an ice cream that is so subtly crafted, so much thought went into this one. Each of the defining characteristics plays well with each other (the cherries, the shortbread, the almond flavor, the sugar cookie), though none is overpowering. You keep going back from one flavor to another, then appreciating each even more upon return. A sense of deep creaminess and vanilla tie everything together. Great texture. If there were a comparison to be made to a layered and multi-dimensional chocolatey dessert, this would be the decadent vanilla counterpart. So satisfying, you’ll be scooping up any available pints at your local grocer before someone else finds it... I know I have. Bravo.\n",
            "Please please please keep this flavor! I tried it as a shake at my local Ben and Jerry's shop and it has to be the best shake I have ever had. The flavors are subtle and delicious and make you want more! I would buy this flavor everytime, all the parts work so well together and are so balanced! My new favorite flavor for sure!!! I love the almond and cookie flavors and the cherry is just a sweet hint and not too overpowering. Seriously, please keep this flavor around!\n",
            "I had this at the scoop shop Friday then went on a mission to find the pints! Please don’t ever stop making this one! It is so good with the cookie dough and cherries. Perfectly balanced and just the right amount of sweetness!!\n",
            "I love chocolate, but my girlfriend haaaates it, she's always so bummed out that almost every B&J flavor has chocolate something in it, whether its chips or swirls or chunks, so she was so delighted to see this! I've never seen her finish a pint by herself before. I tried it myself and its super good, I normally don't like cherry flavored stuff but the cherry is mild and not artificial tasting at all. The almond is really good, but the sugar cookie core is the real star of the show. I say this icecream suits someone with a more sophisticated palate.\n",
            "Out of the 3 new cores flavors from B&J's, this one is the best. The cherry ice cream with cherries is just as tasty as in Cherry Garcia. The new sweet cream with a hint of almond flavor is extremely accurate. The almond flavor is there, adding a nuttiness to the taste while not being overpowering. And the core, while just as grainy as the the chocolate chip cookie dough pint, is at least more fitting of a sugar cookie and tastes accurate to the real deal. It's not a set of components that you'd ever imagine together, but it works. Delicious.\n",
            "This is the best ice cream. Ever. Please don't ever kill this off and put in the graveyard!\n",
            "I dont usually venture away from the comforts of gimmie smore. But i read the reviews on this one and had to try it. And let me tell you, if your on the fence for thid unique flavor, jump off of it, go to the store and try this one.\n",
            "Amazing flavors that all stand alone when you eat it. The cookie dough was perfect and the best part. The textures in this ice cream are amazing. Super creamy, squishy cherries, soft but firm short bread, and the grittiness of the dough. Just perfection.\n",
            "My top 3. Gimmie smore, sweet like sugar,canoli\n",
            "I've been waiting yearssssss for something that would resemble \"Mission to Marzipan\" which was discontinued around 2010 or so and I finally found it!! I'm in love, I stumbled upon Sweet like sugar Abt a month ago and have probably eaten 5 cartons since!PLEASE NEVER EVER GET RID OF IT, BEGGING YOU!! The cookie dough, the almond flavor, the cherries!!! PERFECTION\n",
            "I am a huge cherry ice cream lover but hate the chocolate chips that are normally put in it so when this ice cream creation came out I was in LOVE!!! The sugar cookie core is amazing. I usually will buy 4-6 pints when I go to store just to make sure I never run out. Thanks Ben and Jerry for a great new ice cream for us non-chocolate lovers!\n",
            "i don’t like chocolate in ice cream so I’m always trying to find a good flavor without fudge or chocolate. I usually get vanilla or pistachio but this combination sounded good.\n",
            "It was so good, I finished eating the entire pint in a couple of days. In fact, I think this is one of the best tasting ice cream flavor ever!\n",
            "It is like this was made just for me. It is all of my favorite flavors combined in one. The almond flavor is a good balance. It isn't too strong or overpowering. The cookies and swirl are different enough to bring their own element. I love this creation. Please don't ever let this one go. My newest addiction!\n",
            "My brother loves shortbread cookies and cherry ice cream so I thought I’d get him this as a going away present before he left for summer camp. Me and my mom ended up eating almost all of it... oops sorry bro :/ but honestly it was THAT good! This is definitely one of my new favorite flavors!\n",
            "I loved it, I just didn’t eat the cherry ice cream because I’m not a big fan of it due to my allergy\n",
            "This is by far my favorite ice cream! I love the almond and cherry flavors mixed with the crunch of the sugar in the dough. The best part: NO Chocolate!\n",
            "Unfortunately, it is impossible to find since March :( I’m worried it will disappear like “Cool Britannia...”\n",
            "If you like sugar cookies with that lovely hint of almond and vanilla flavor, they pair perfectly with the cherry ice cream in this pint! The cookie bits are a little dry, but otherwise this is my new favorite B&J flavor. The almond and cherry ice creams are subtle but perfect, and the sugar cookie dough core is delicious and just the right flavor. I don't know how they could make this one so delicious and fail so badly with the chocolate chip cookie dough core, but I'm not going to argue about it!\n",
            "Please, please don’t ever send this flavor to the graveyard. It is hands down the best flavor I have ever had. There is half a pint sitting in my freezer right now and I will divorce my husband if he thinks he can finish that off... that’s how good it is.\n",
            "I am not one to write reviews and I am typically not one to like elaborate mash-ups but they outdid themselves with this flavor. If I could drop one ingredient, I'd cut out the cherry chunks but this is so well done we are just nit picking. A must try.\n",
            "This is the BEST B&J ice cream I have ever tasted. Almond sweet cream ice cream tastes so much like the Italian 7 layer bar cookies. That hint of Almond is to die for. And the cookie dough core...don't get me started. Drooling....!!\n",
            "I am not a fan of cherry ice cream, however I love almond flavored desserts and cookie dough. The cherry was not fake tasting or overpowering and the almond ice cream and cookie core was amazing. Definitely a good choice!\n",
            "I recently tried each of the newest core flavors and this one takes the cake. It’s bursting with flavor, the core is delicious, everything about it is A+. Definitely one of the best flavors in my opinion!\n",
            "I love this ice cream! I love ice cream, but I'm allergic to chocolate. All the best flavors have chocolate in them, so I end up walking up and down the ice cream isles with a broken heart. I long for better non-chocolate options. This is life changing! Thank you Ben and Jerry's for giving me a pint of joy to brighten my days.\n",
            "Also, maybe you guys could consider seeing if there is a market for something fun with carob or carob chips...? Just an unrealistic dream I have.\n",
            "Thanks again!\n",
            "It literally taste just like its name!!\n",
            "Very yummy well paired ingredients\n",
            "It has dark sweet cherries, chewy and sweet shortbread and a sugary cookie core throughout\n",
            "Well done B&J\n",
            "This flavor is hand's-down my new favorite B&J flavor and I hope it never goes away. It is very smooth, with nothing over-powering, and the cherries are a nice touch.\n",
            "You’ve turned an ice cream hater into an ice cream lover. Thank you, B&J! PS) I added some walnuts to mine.\n",
            "So delicious!! My new go to flavor!! Please keep this one around!! It is a keeper lol so good mmm mmm mmm\n",
            "A sugar cookie dough core?! Almond and cherry?! One of the best flavors ever. Don't ever get rid of it.\n",
            "This is a sweet, super-delicious almond-y sugar cookie flavor. One of my favorites of recent years.\n",
            "My favorite flavor ever! I do wish the almond flavor was a little more prominent though.\n",
            "Catch me at the grocery store buying out the whole stock this flavor is SO good!\n",
            "This might be my favorite Ben and Jerry's flavor. The sweet cream base with that subtle hint of almond really blends well with everything else. The smooth creamy texture mixes really well with the sugar cookie dough core and the slightly grainy texture. The cherries add yet another texture and a bit of tartness as well. If you like the pistachio flavor with the sweet cream and want more flavor and texture variety, I'd try this.\n",
            "After being taunted by online ads for nearly two months, I finally found this flavor in a grocery store near me. It did not disappoint! All of the flavors are balanced, the shortbread pieces are delicious, the cherries are sweet and juicy... My only complaint is that I wish the cookie dough core was more \"doughy\", as it has a sugary paste consistency instead. Every time I see this flavor, I make sure to grab two pints. Amazing!\n",
            "One of the only flavors that I can honestly say I can eat every day. I've probably bought more than ten so far. Cherry and almond flavors are well-balanced and lovingly tied together with shortbread cookie. This ice cream showcases the beauty in simplicity, and really takes your appreciation of sweet cream to a whole new level. It is by no means as intense (or obnoxious) as other flavors, but this is what makes it shine.\n",
            "This ice cream is delicious. The almond flavor is subtle but still there, and the shortbread pieces are AMAZING. The sugar cookie dough has a great texture and flavor as well. If you love almond and/or cherry, I would definitely buy this flavor. Only downfall is that it is extremely hard to find this flavor, as I had to drive nearly 3 hours to locate a pint of the Sweet Like Sugar Cookie Dough Core Ice Cream.\n",
            "Wow!!!\n",
            "Flavors are just fantastic\n",
            "I am not a big ice cream person but when I was with my husband and 3 boys they all got this and couldn’t stop talking about it. So I decided to try it and now I am hooked. It’s so addicting.\n",
            "Went to the store found 4 pints left and bought all 4. Please don’t ever send to graveyard.\n",
            "Thank you Ben and Jerry’s for making this flavor it’s truly the best ever. Well done!!\n",
            "This is hands down my favorite Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream Flavor. As someone who does not like chocolate, it is very hard to find an ice cream flavor that doesn't have some type of chocolate mixed in. This is just perfect! I used to eat Cherry Garcia and spit out the chocolate bits (don't call me crazy)... Well -This is a non-chocolate Cherry Garcia + Sugar Cookie dream and it is just so delicious!\n",
            "I bought this the other day, and it was as delicious as I expected. However, I couldn't tell the difference between the almond and the cherry ice creams. If it weren't for the cherries and the shortbread pieces, I wouldn't have known there was a difference at all. Maybe toasted, salted almond slices instead of shortbread would make the almond ice cream stand out more.\n",
            "I bought this 3 weeks ago on a whim. Sometimes chocolate just isn’t what your in the mood for! It was amazing ice cream! Every bite was deeeee licious! Then the virus hit the nation and it can’t be found ! I’m so sad ! Please keep this flavor going.... I will be buying TONS more! Love this! If you haven’t tried it, give it a whirl! You will be pleasantly surprised!\n",
            "Not very good. Usually with the core ice creams they have a lot more flavor. I found that this ice cream lacked so much flavor it could barely tell the difference between to the 2 sides. Easily the worst out of the core ice creams... I was let down. Please bring back the cheesecake core!\n",
            "For the love of all that is good in this world, don't ever stop selling this flavor! I usually go for the chocolatey flavors, but I went out on a limb to try this recently and I might not ever go back. Buttery shortbread dough, chewy cherry chunks like in Cherry Garcia, and a tinge of amaretto, make for a chunky, chewy, creamy--oops. I ate the whole pint!\n",
            "This is maybe the most unique option in the ice cream market today. I’ve never had anything like it. The delicate flavors of the sweet cream and almond and cherry go so nicely together, none overpowers any of the others, they just peacefully coexist. And that core. My god. I cannot quit thinking about it. It’s a sandy, almost gritty (not in a bad way—in an I cannot quit thinking about that mouthfeel way!) sugar cookie dough texture and the contrast of that against the soft smooth flavors of the ice cream..I literally cannot quit thinking about it. I just discovered this a few weeks ago and have been through three pints. I have never had any ice cream like it. I am not seeing it restocked so I’m afraid it’s discontinued and I’m going to be devastated. I’d been buying ALDI’s generic Cherry Garcia because, it’s just BETTER, sorry for the blasphemy but it’s the truth. And this brought me back to the brand. I hope it’s restocked soon.\n",
            "Just tried this flavor for the first time last month and it has now become my only favorite flavor. So much so that I’ve stocked many pints already. I love that there is no\n",
            "chocolate in this as I am allergic. This flavor tops all that I’ve tried, all brands . The blend of cherry, almond shortbtrad cookie and the sugar dough core is a perfect combo.\n",
            "I purchased this flavor after waiting over a month for it to appear in stores! It is delightful, the flavors meld together beautifully, and are not overpowering. The cookie core is tasty, and the cherry chunks are juicy, flavorful, and plenty! The hint of almond pulls it all together for a perfect finish. I do believe I've found my new favorite!\n",
            "I've been eating B&J since I was 13. This is by far my favorite Ice Cream of all time! the almond flavored base ice cream is unique and subtle but flavorful. I love how the sugar cookie dough and shortbread bits are countered by the acidity of the cherries and how that flavor profile is made more delicious combined with the almond. Well Done B&J!\n",
            "I contemplated buying this on multiple occasions but was afraid it would be too sweet. I finally gave in and was truly surprised. The cookie core was sweet but had enough buttery saltiness to make it addictive. The ice cream was subtle and perfectly balanced by the cookie core. I easily could have eaten the whole pint in one sitting\n",
            "As much as I love chocolate, it's great to have more flavor options that don't have chocolate in them. I really like the combination of almond and cherry. With the sugar cookie core, it reminds me a little bit of marzipan. (It would be great to have a flavor with actual marzipan in it. Hint. Hint.)\n",
            "Cherries and surgar cookies can make the perfect concoction. For me, this ice cream tastes like sugar cookie batter (which is my peronsal all time favorite treat.) It's filled with chunks of soft cherries and cookie dough which somehow compliments each other.\n",
            "My new fave! This is the Bomb Cyclone of deliciousness!!! Love Sugar Cookie Dough? Sweet Cream Ice Cream? Almond Essence? Shortbread Cookies? Cherries? BAM!! Mix all of that up and it's Ice Cream Heaven! Ben and Jerry...y'all knocked this one out of the park. Keep this on ON DECK!!!\n",
            "Literally the best ice cream I have ever had hands-down! I am a huge fan of cherry Garcia, and PhiSh food, but this ice cream really takes the cake. The name seems misleading though because it doesn’t talk anything about the delicious scrumptious cherry which is my favorite part\n",
            "I was amazed how these different flavors come together to make an absolutely delicious ice cream core flavor! I love the sweet gritty sugar of the sugar cookie dough, the taste and almond aroma, vanilla and the right amount of cherry to make this my new favorite flavor!!!\n",
            "If you try this ice cream, you will never stop craving it. Flavor combo is intoxicating. If you’re eating straight out of the carton there’s no way to not finish it. I had to start working out for the first time in 5+ years thanks to this deliciously infuriating ice cream.\n",
            "I was really hesitant to try this flavor for many reasons but it is AMAZING. The cherry is perfect and not overpowering and the almond flavor perfectly compliments it. The sugar cookie dough core is so much better than the chocolate chip cookie dough core.\n",
            "I purchased this Sweet Like Sugar Cookie Dough ice cream once and fell in love. I have purchased many more pints since then! This is the best ice cream I have ever had. It is sweet and has the cherry flavor that mixes perfectly with the cookie dough.\n",
            "I dream about this ice cream, it's SO GOOD! The only bummer is that it's always sold out so I've only gotten to enjoy it a couple times.\n",
            "The two flavors are more subtle which is why I love it! I’m not a fan of super over done and sugary flavors, which this is not. The almond cookie side is my fav, I wish they just made that in a pint size. Best flavor :)\n",
            "I bought this a month ago and I just bought another pint last week! This pint core flavor is one that is sweet but not overly sweet with this flavor combination. Hopefully won’t have to see this flavor go!\n",
            "I decided to switch from Cherry Garcia and try this. I was super disappointed! There were only about three cherries in the entire pint and the core was way too sweet. Definitely will not buy this again.\n",
            "I accidentally bought this instead of cookie dough. I feel fooled\n",
            "This is by far the best ice cream Ben & Jerry’s has ever made, and that’s saying a lot because most of their ice creams are amazing. I hope they never stop making this. It’s absolutely delicious!\n",
            "This was one of the most surprisingly yummy ice cream flavors, textures I have ever had. I say mmmmmm with every single bite. Please keep on making this SWeet as sugar ice cream. just heavely.\n",
            "Got it last week and was surprised how well almond, cherry, and shortbread went together in this pint! Tried to buy it again today at different store but outta luck. Will be getting it again!\n",
            "This might be one of my top B&J flavors of all time. The only way it could be better would be more cherries and cookie dough in each pint. Please consider making a vegan version of this!\n",
            "I HAVE REALLY FELL OFF OF THE ICE CREAM BAND WAGON BECAUSE I CANNOT FIND ANYTHING I LIKE FOR THE LIFE OF ME. I AM BEYOND OBSESSED WITH THESE FLAVORS AND COOKIE DOUGH IN THE CENTER! YES!\n",
            "I love icecream, almost every kind, but now I have a favorite! \"Sweet like Sugar\" cookie dough core icecream hits all the notes like a beautiful symphony. Thank you Ben and Jerry. ;)\n",
            "Just downed a pint and it's already ascended to near the top on my list of all-time favorite flavors. Going to snag another pint in the morning... hopefully they won't be sold out!\n",
            "This flavor is soooo good!! The cherry and almond flavors together are perfect and the cookie dough core has that great gritty cookie dough texture! This is one of my new faves!\n",
            "Oh wow this is good... Made an ice cream sandwich with this and two pecan sandies... Yum.\n",
            "But they still need to bring back the chocolate cherry Garcia reverse limited batch.\n",
            "The core was so sweet and just the right flavor. The smooth almond ice cream goes so well with the cherries and the sugar cookie! This ice cream flavor will not disappoint!\n",
            "Omg I brought this ice cream yesterday and was thinking about it at work lol couldn't wait to get home. This ice cream is amazing!!!!! Definitely my favorite!!!!!!\n",
            "I discovered this flavor because it was on closeout at a store i shop. It is incredible. The flavors go together so well and that sugar cookie core is heaven.\n",
            "I'm eating it right now. It's okay but not one of my favorites. Kind of plain.\n",
            "I bought this yesterday, and I love the ice cream. My only complaint is, there was no cherry ice cream in it. Mine was all vanilla. Still loved it!!!\n",
            "I just got this flavor, it's now my favorite. I'm not a chocolate fan so this was my first choice to try. Now I love it. Thank you for making this.\n",
            "Don't let the name fool you, it is not as sweet as i thought it was going to be. The almond flavor is amazing, and its definitely become a favorite.\n",
            "I am not an ice cream person but I saw this and bought it on a whim because I love almond flavor and cherries. It is SO good! Glad I found it.\n",
            "This is literally the best ice cream I have ever had. The almond flavor, sugar cookie core, cherries... everything about it is amazing!!!!!\n",
            "The ice cream was delicious! I was sad that the core wasn’t centered in the middle & was shallow compared to other core ice creams.\n",
            "I tried this for the first time today and it’s hands-down the best ice cream I’ve ever had. Please don’t stop making this flavor!\n",
            "I first found this flavor about two months ago and i can not get enough! This is my favorite flavor and i highly recommend it!!!\n",
            "I usually always get one pint of ice cream during a trip to walmart, this is the best ice cream l’ve ever had!! Super delicious\n",
            "Best. Flavor. Ever. I love the cherry without all the chocolate pieces. More cherries!! The sweet cream/almond is delicious.\n",
            "This and Chip Happens are the best new flavors in a looooong time; the flavor combo and the sugar cookie core are delicious.\n",
            "Don’t ever take this flavor away. Or I’ll find you. But for real, I don’t know if life is worth living without this flavor.\n",
            "Didn’t know I’d like almond flavor... now I love it. I used to be a half baked guy, but I’ve converted to sweet like sugar.\n",
            "Unique flavors, when together it’s perfection:) was looking for something without the chocolate flavor this hit the spot!\n",
            "The only core ice cream that I like! Almost ate the entire pint. The best ice cream since Jimmy Fallon's late night snack!\n",
            "The flavor combo is amazing but the sugar cookie core doesn’t taste like as sweet as sugar cookie, kinda made me sad\n",
            "I love this. The flavors go so well together. Would love a version without the core, although it’s amazing with!\n",
            "i dream about it\n",
            "it’s a little scary\n",
            "perfect mix of textures\n",
            "and one of b&j’s few chocolate-free varieties\n",
            "So so good! Does everyone feel how I do about this flavor? My local stores are sold out, I’m so sad. Lol.\n",
            "This flavor is way too sweet and I wouldn’t recommend it to someone unless they want to eat pure sugar\n",
            "I am so in love with this ice cream!!! Finally a cookie dough ice cream WITHOUT chocolate chips!!!!!\n",
            "This is my absolute favorite! The most delicious flavor combination! Seriously the best ever!!\n",
            "Hope they add this to their permanent lineup of flavors! There’s no combo like this out there\n",
            "I bought this ice cream cause it was a new flavor. It's a good thing cause its tasty, yummy!\n",
            "This is so good.... I am actually sad that I found it because now I eat it... almost daily.\n",
            "The ice cream sounds pretty good, but I'd prefer it if it didn't have the cherry stuff.\n",
            "Probably my new favorite. All the components are good on their own and together.\n",
            "If you like sweet this is the best Ben and Jerry’s flavor hands down!\n",
            "This ice cream is the best. It’s my favourite out of all the cores.\n",
            "Best ice cream flavor yet. Only flavor I will currently buy.\n",
            "This is the best ice cream ever!! Love the sugar cookie core\n",
            "Super Yummy! Would definitely buy anytime I see it offered.\n",
            "Could you like never stop selling this please? I will die.\n",
            "So happy I tried this. My favorite ice cream of all time!\n",
            "My new favorite ice cream. Could use more cherry chunks\n",
            "This flavor is so hard to find but this is my favorite!\n",
            "I can’t get enough of this flavor! Delicious flavors.\n",
            "even better than chubby hubby and urban bourban. yum!\n",
            "I love love love these flavors! One of my new favs!\n",
            "Best flavor ever. Please don’t ever get rid of it.\n",
            "Open your freezer. Do you see ice cream that isn't Wake & No Bake Cookie Dough Core? That's your first mistake. Get in your car, on your bike, or in your hovercar and go to the closest store for this. Don't believe it's THAT good? That's your second mistake.\n",
            "When I saw this I was so excited because I’ve been making no bake cookies with my grandma years! ( hers are the best I’ve ever had ;) ) aside from that I personally like to add a little more peanut butter to the cookie mixture which would’ve been nice in this cookie core. The peanut butter cookies didn’t taste like peanut butter to me. The vanilla ice cream was fine, just subtle enough to let everything else shine. The best way to eat no bakes is while they’re still warm and not set up with a big glass of milk. I thought no bakes were an Oklahoma thing so I’m happy to see them represented in a product that’s sold worldwide.\n",
            "I bought this thinking the name was just kinda funny(love you guys for it!) But I was sceptical due to not being a big fan of your core series of ice creams. I had always found the core to be over powering, not allowing the rest of the ice cream to really shine, but this was totally different! This one some how is lighter, not to over bearing, and yet still brings the spoonful of chocolate to the table. Maybe its the oats, maybe its the amount of cocoa in the mix, who knows. But yall nailed it on the head this time! Really hope this stays, happy to have found something else chocolaty from you guys other then my usual Tonight Dough.\n",
            "I went from psyched when I first saw these were out, to wary when I'd heard several pans of this flavor, to delighted when I decided to try it anyway (and wondering why I ever doubted myself)! I thought the base flavors were a little muted, yes, but the core and mix-ins were great--not too gargantuan fudge chips, soft and chewy cookies (not dry like some have experienced), and a really unique and fun core. Plus, my particular pint was quality-control goals--solid core all the way through the container, not a single air pocket, and plenty of mix-ins distributed from top to bottom too!\n",
            "Finallly found this flavor. Vanilla ice cream is good but plain. Peanut butter cookie dough pieces are smaller than I expected and have a bland/dry taste. Chocolate cookie core is mediocre at best. Not as full of topping as expected. I’m disappointed.\n",
            "A lot of reviews you can tell these people have no idea what the core is supposed to be. It's not supposed to be like traditional cookie dough. It perfectly emulates the flavor and texture of classic no-bake cookies. A mixture primarily of chocolate, peanut butter, and oats dropped onto wax paper and cooled to form \"cookies\" that you don't need to bake.\n",
            "My favorite cookie in the form of a Ben and Jerry's ice cream? YES PLEASE! It is delicious. Go get some now, yes now!\n",
            "Just got a pint of this tonight, it looked so good in the store! But not so good at home. Mostly tastes like vanilla, very little peanut butter. Core part was good, but misaligned and had an air pocket so didn’t get as much as usual. Will be passing on this flavor in the future.\n",
            "This flavor sounded so good but it was a let down for me. The vanilla ice cream was pretty bland and the chunks weren’t so good. Very small chocolate pieces and the peanut butter cookies tasted dry and also not very flavorful. Then the core just tasted like gritty sugar. It was really strange actually because normally I love all Ben & Jerry’s flavors. I don’t get why it was called cookie dough core because it was like a gritty paste with hard chunks (maybe oats?). I was expecting it to actually be the cookie dough that’s in their other ice creams. It almost seemed like all the sugar in the container went to the core because it was so sweet (yet still not good tasting) and the rest was so bland. This was a big miss. Maybe something went wrong with this batch because I can’t imagine they would want to produce this variety if they tasted it first. I’d recommend passing on this! one.\n",
            "Listen, the flavor combo = amazing. The peanut butter ice cream is rich and delicious and the vanilla balances it out. But the cookie core. The freaking. Cookie. Core. It is SO DELICIOUS. It’s chocolatey and a little peanut buttery and with little oatmeal (?) texture bits. It’s truly such an incredible flavor, I could barely stop eating the pint. Please don’t get rid of this!!!\n",
            "This is delicious. As I sit here eating this, I'm thinking this is definitely one of my favorites from Ben and Jerry's. The core really complements the peanut butter cookie dough, and the texture feels so good in my mouth. This is a winner for sure.\n",
            "The core tastes just like my mom’s no bake cookie recipe I loved growing up! I’m not the biggest fan of vanilla ice cream, but it’s used perfectly here to balance the richness. So hard not to eat the whole pint!\n",
            "Where has this been all my life? No-bake cookies are possibly my favorite kind of cookie, so this core is TO DIE FOR. I saw another reviewer here didn't like it because they were expecting regular cookie dough -- I am concerned that they have never eaten a no-bake cookie before, which would be terribly sad if true. In any case, they're right: this cookie dough core is quite different from regular cookie dough. It's BETTER.\n",
            "I loke trying all the B&J ice creams and this one was AWESOME! I loved the peanut butter ice cream , cookie, and the chocolate core...just delicious!!\n",
            "The core is grainy, dry, hard, and tastes nothing like cookie dough. Honestly I thought it was stale at first glance--does this kind of cookie dough get stale? Did I get a bad batch?\n",
            "No Bake Cookies are my favorite! This ice cream has the taste down. So good! Need to buy more and keep it in case if emergencies.\n",
            "I just tried this flavor on gopuff and my thoughts are the core has a weird taste and doesn’t taste like “cookie dough” like your other cookie dough core does, but Ice cream is tasty and accurately described.\n",
            "The second best of the cookie dough core lineup, \"Wake and No Bake\" is tasty. The theme here is peanut butter and chocolate and the flavor delivers for the most part. The peanut butter ice cream goes perfectly with the fudge chips, so that works, but could've used more fudge chips. The vanilla ice cream tastes weak and only takes away from the peanut butter, while the peanut butter cookies taste a bit dry. What saves this flavor though is the \"No Bake\" core. It's absolutely delicious. The core tastes like a well balanced combination of chocolate and peanut butter while having a unique gritty/chunk texture. Some changes could've definitely improved this flavor but it's still a good chocolate/peanut butter mix overall.\n",
            "The core is so small. But not as small as the supposedly pb cookie chunks. It tastes amazing otherwise !! More pb cookies & bigger core\n",
            "Core was great but a little disappointed in the actual ice cream flavors. The PB ice cream was underwhelming and hard to differentiate from the vanilla. Loved the peanut butter cookie chunks but could definitely use more fudge flakes, especially since the PB was so hard to taste.\n",
            "Eh, not my favorite. The core was very, very hard, and I had a difficult time breaking it up with my spoon. The peanut butter cookie dough wasn’t much better. It was dry and kind of flavorless - if you had me try one blindfolded, I wouldn’t be able to tell you what it was. I found myself picking out the core and peanut butter cookie dough pieces so that I could enjoy the vanilla and peanut butter ice creams, which were good. Not terrible, but won’t buy again.\n",
            "This is one of those ice creams where if you don't get a good pint of it, it's not very good. I agree with a lot of others on their reviews when they say the peanut butter side is bland, the vanilla side really comes through, the peanut butter cookie pieces are definitely dry and crumbly and not like a dough at all. And finally we get to the ever famous core. The core was a pretty big let down in multiple ways. First off, its always a different size in each pint. I also think it goes bad or gets almost freezer burnt tasting pretty quick even though the ice cream is not freezer burnt. It has a gritty, chocolatey and oat center. I definitely feel like more effort could be made to make this a better ice cream because the idea is amazing!!\n",
            "Seriously get this stuff!!!! My boyfriend and I ate the whole pint in one sitting\n",
            "I bought some Wake and No Bake ice cream the other day at my local Walmart here in Texas. I ate half of it before I realized it was only Vanilla ice cream, peanut butter cookie dough pieces, and the chocolate cookie dough center. I think there was only a few Fudge chips and NO Peanut Butter ice cream. While it was delicious, as most Ben&Jerry's ice creams are, I was disappointed because I was in the mood for Peanut Butter Ice Cream with the fudge chips. Maybe a little quality control is needed for this product. Thanks.\n",
            "My husband and I are Ben & Jerry's HOUNDS. Anytime it's on sale or a new one comes out, we have to try it. So naturally, we were psyched to see that there were new flavors, and we bought all three. The Wake and \"No Bake\" had to be one if the grittiest and tasteless concoctions that has ever come from this brand. Honestly, it was terrible. The only \"flavor\" present was a weird burnt sugar after taste. Yikes.\n",
            "I usually can’t put the spoon down when eating this ice cream, but it wasn’t hard to do with this flavor. The cookie dough bites seemed like they were flavorless, non-sugar pieces and the peanut butter cookie pieces were also pretty bland. The ice cream itself tasted okay, but I will definitely not eat this flavor again.\n",
            "I purchased this today (6/3/19) at my local Kroger store. Usually, Ben and Jerry's can't be beat. However, this flavor is terrible. Very bland and the No-Bake cookie dough core is very gritty and stale tasting. I was very disappointed with this flavor pairing and would not recommend.\n",
            "I am psyched to live close to a B&J shop, especially when they have a limited pint, and a great selection of fresh hand packed. Wake and No Bake has to be good in a store pint, right? I hope, because I went with Wake and No Bake from hand packed, just seemed unusual. Super excited to finish dinner and pop the top. Well, it was just a blend of vanilla-ish and peanut-ish with some dry crumbs. Oh, what core? No idea, didn’t see or taste it. Hope stores bought is better. I’ll try it.\n",
            "Like others said, the description of the ice cream leads to a huge let down. As a fan of the peanut butter cup ice cream, I was excited to try this as it features peanut butter cookies and peanut butter ice cream. The peanut butter ice cream is undifferentiable from the vanilla ice cream, the cookie pieces are dry and tasteless, and the no bake cookie dough core is equally tastelss. I shan't stray from peanut butter cup again!\n",
            "I've had this a few times now and my only complaint is that I wish there was more core!! It's so delicious!\n",
            "I loved this ice cream. I've always been a fan of no bake cookies (for those not familiar with them, they're peanut butter, chocolate, oatmeal chunks that you eat. They're chewy and aren't like regular cookies or cookie dough), and the core was the best part! It was a little grittier than normal because of the temperature, but not enough to be off-putting. The peanut butter flavor in the ice cream was great also, and I'll be getting this again for sure!\n",
            "This flavor is terrible. The peanut butter ice cream seemed essentially flavorless, there are very few fudge chips, the peanut butter cookie dough bites were hard and dry, and the core was borderline inedible. As another review said, the texture was like gritty sugar. I'm so confused about what this core is supposed to be. This is the very first Ben & Jerry's flavor I've ever less-than-loved.\n",
            "Couldn’t wait for the new core flavors and so far all three are a disappointment! This flavor core is tasty but very grainy. The peanut butter icecream is pretty good. The vanilla is blah and the peanut butter cookie pieces have a faint taste. So far no core ice cream is better than the Peanut Buttah Cookie Core!!!\n",
            "Even though there was only a little core to the pint that I bought it was still very good! No regrets at all in fact I would eat two or three pints of wake and no bake cookie dough core ice cream. It was still extremely delicious and I’m still glad I bought it and I plan to buy it again as soon as I’m out and about at the grocery store. As a matter of fact I would recommend this to every one and this would have to be my absolute favorite.\n",
            "No-bake cookies are my absolute favorite cookies. They are like blobs of chocolate peanut butter oatmeal fudge. So for me, the core is basically crack. The ice cream is kinda boring, maybe a chocolate malt or banana would be better? The peanut butter cookies are DRY and totally ruined the whole thing. Why cookies in a 'no-bake' themed ice cream, obviously should be cookie dough. Just sayin'.\n",
            "Bought it for 6 bucks and change at cub because everyone said it was good, it was way overpriced and the cookie dough core only went down half way. I could have gotten a cookies dough kemps gallon for cheaper and there would have been far more cookie dough. I had the love banana chocolate and grahm cracker one awhile back, that one was good, this one was huge disappointment.\n",
            "Me and my boyfriend love LOVE LOVE ben and jerry's. We usually have a pint every week. Our favorites are milk and cookies or boom chocolota core. BUT THIS ONE HERE.... not worth it. It was very very bland and we didn't understand the core? Worst then great value walmart ice cream.\n",
            "This is the second of the three new 2019 core dough flavors that I’ve tried. Is it better than the chocolate chip cookie dough core one? Yes. But not by much. The peanut butter ice cream is good, the vanilla ice cream with the chips is boring. The pieces of peanut butter cookie are little and bland. Way too much ice cream to dough ratio. The core is...ok.\n",
            "I was super excited when I saw this flavor and decided to give it a shot but I was not so impressed. The peanut butter cookie dough was very Minimal. After reading the reviews it seems like this ice cream is very inconsistent the peanut butter flavor in mine was incredibly delicious and you could taste it as soon as it hit your tongue. The vanilla was definitely a little bland but most vanilla is unless you purchase a French vanilla type ice cream. The core has a very off putting aftertaste I did see a review that this is what the core is supposed to look like taste like because that's what no bake cookies are and though I've never really had no bake cookie is I'm wondering if my pint taste different then that other persons pint because some of the reviews said they couldn't taste the peanut butter but I can taste the peanut butter spot on and some more saying that the core is delicious and for me it's not the texture of the core it's thing really badd aftertaste at leaves in your mouth that put me off I really hope this flavor goes through a remake because I think it could be really good.\n",
            "What a mixed bag these new pints are. This Wake and No Bake is not an exception. The core, like the other is rock hard but at least it tastes good. The ice cream, both side of it, is not bad, not good, just kind of mediocre. The mix ins were few in my pint. Kind of let down. I won’t be buying this one again.\n",
            "I love Ben and Jerry’s ice cream, but this core flavor was disappointing. The ice cream and cookie bits were fine, but I don’t know what was going on with the core! It was grainy and hard to chew and tasted nothing like cookie dough. I would get any other flavor before picking this one up. Super disappointed.\n",
            "The no-bake cookie dough core was alright, the ice cream itself was really, really bland and boring. The dough pieces throughout had almost no flavor and I could hardly tell the difference between the two different sides. Unfortunately wouldn’t ever buy again, even if it was on clearance for $1\n",
            "I love trying new flavors and the Wake and No Bake sounded like an exciting new flavor to try. It was a total let down. The \"core\" was gritty and I wouldn't consider it a core since it was only at the top of the pint. I also didn't taste peanut butter ice cream and didn't see any fudge chips.\n",
            "I enjoyed the ice cream part of this but the core was disgusting. It says it's a cookie dough core and I figured \"wow that sounds good\" but then when I tried it the core is this awful dry nougaty chocolate and was not at all like how it is labeled. I will never again buy this flavor.\n",
            "I lost a lot of weight after having my daughter and gained it back by eating a pint of B&J everyday for a YEAR. I may not be a food scientists or sensory analysts but I do consider myself a bit of an expert when it comes to B&J. I know what no-bake cookies are so I didn't expect this to remind me of regular cookie dough. That being said, this was the most disappointing pint I've had and I am pretty sure I have tried every flavor available within 15 miles. Even the plain vanilla seems to have more flavor than the vanilla half of this pint. B&J is known for their generosity when it comes chunks, but there were 6-8 PB cookie dough balls in the entire pint. The peanut butter half was supposed to have chocolate chunks but there was literally not a single chocolate chunk in the entire pint. And the cookie core didn't really have flavor. It was hard and gritty with just a hint of chocolate flavor- not at all what I would expect from the geniuses who brought us miracles like Phish Food and Cinnabuns and Seven Layer Bar. I would highly recommend that you skip this pint and try another flavor... ANY OTHER FLAVOR.\n",
            "I thought I had reached my peak, my zenith if you will. But I was wrong. I took one bite of this creamy, chocolately no bakey concoction and a euphoria shot through my veins quicker than a prairie dog through a dirt tube. You did it again Ben and J-dog, you sly scoundrels <3\n",
            "i sent my husband to multiple stores to find this, it is one of my favorite flavors ever of any brand of ice cream...the texture of the cookie core is AMAZING and so tasty!! Love the texture of the peanut butter cookies in the ice cream too!\n",
            "So happy I bought a pint of the new Wake & No Bake Cookie Dough Core flavor! I loved the taste/texture of the cookie dough core the most, and combined with the yummy gobs of peanut butter cookies--I was in heaven! Will definitely buy again.\n",
            "I prefer my ice cream mostly plain but I tried this one and I cannot stop buying it every time I go to the store as well as finishing it every time I open it probably my favorite ice cream ever thank you for my new addiction!\n",
            "This a great flavor and the cookie core is so good! I cannot believe it is getting so many bad reviews, whats wrong with these people? Its ice cream, for cryin out loud! Try this one for yourself before judging!\n",
            "A friend first bought this for me as a joke, but when I tasted it I was instantly in heaven. I have bought this ice cream every week since first eating it, and I have to say it's easily my favorite ice cream.\n",
            "This is just about the perfect flavor for me. I love the combination of chocolate and peanut butter, and the no-bake chocolate oatmeal cookie center is such a fond reminder of my childhood. LOVE IT!!\n",
            "I got this today and was excited because it sounded so good. It definitely was not! There was hardly any chocolate chunks, the core was awful, tasted nothing like a no bake cookie. So disappointing.\n",
            "Best ice cream to get if you love peanut butter and cookie dough. Perfect balance of flavors and this combo fits a whole in the B&J lineup as well as the overall ice cream market.\n",
            "The core does not taste like or resemble cookie dough, and besides the core, its pretty much all vanilla icecream with a hint of peanutbutter flavor.\n",

            "Each flavor is better than the last what a delicious idea\n",
            "Newly made its way into my Top 5. I had this flavor at a scoop shop and then was ecstatic to find it in Pint size!\n",
            "You did it again Ben & Jerry!\n",
            "Im going to re-name this flavor to\n",
            "\"Angela's next 10 pounds\"\n",
            "the peanut butter cookies literally taste like flour and the \"core\" texture is unsettling and pretty disturbing.\n",
            "I love no bakes, seems like it was skimped when you made it. Still love B&J, just not this flavor.\n",
            "I love the chocolate crunchies in this! It reminds me of the perfect ice cream cake in a pint!\n",
            "love the concept, poor execution. One of the few times Bernard and Gerald let me down\n",
            "By far my favorite flavor, wish I had discover it sooner. I love no bake cookies!!\n",
            "Doesn’t taste like cookies at all and the core is a really weird texture.\n",
            "I love no bake cookies and this is an amazing way to get them\n",
            "Best I've cream I've ever had. Everything I love all in one\n",
            "Just bought it and loving it can't wait to try them all\n",
            "total let down. especially with the ridiculous price.\n",
            "I love this flavor and buy it frequently. However, in the last six months a few of my pints have been “dried out”. The brownie pieces completely crumble and the batter center is as hard as a rock. I know this isn’t how it’s suppsed to be because when it’s right its amazing and my favorite flavor. I’m attaching pictures of the dried out pieces.\n",
            "Brownie batter is like a chocolate lovers dream. Unfortunately with the core series it's a hit or miss, even if you find a suitable flavor you still play chance with even having one. This was essentially just chocolate and vanilla ice cream. I found the core after a couple spoon fulls and it was heaven. I had a feeling it'd be short lived and I was right the core disappeared before I made it to the bottom. Didn't even mind the missing brownie, just add more core !\n",
            "I got this flavor instead of my usual core flavor and was disappointed. Its not that its bad so to speak, it was just...not good. I had to force myself to eat this flavor just to not let the food go to waste. Usually Ben and Jerry use pretty good ingredients, but this time, something in the core just didn't settle taste wise with me. It tasted almost artificial. Not like brownie batter at all. I probably would have been happier with plain old chocolate or vanilla ice cream on their own. The core ruined it for me. Not to mention that there wasn't very much of it, which turned out in my favor because once the core was gone, the ice cream was slightly more enjoyable.\n",
            "The first few spoon fulls were amazing.. but as soon as I hit the middle section the core disappeared. The core disappearing half way through was disappointing since I was expecting the core to be consistent all the way to the bottom. Such amazing tasting ice cream just wish the core continued throughout the whole pint.\n",
            "Let’s say you were baking brownies and decided to lick the bowl. However, now you add in chocolate and vanilla ice cream to the mix. Sounds amazing right? Well it doesn’t stop there, now you throw in pieces of brownie to top it all off. It was like perfection in ice cream form. I think this came straight from the kitchen of the big man himself. I just sent my husband back to the grocery store because he forgot to pick up my icecream or I threatened to unrelentlessly nag him for the next hour. That’s how good it is. My core went from top to bottom like icecream intestines so I’m not sure about previous faults, but the issue appears to be solved here in SC. Good work on this one!\n",
            "I bought this item but less than halfway through the pint the core disappeared I'm disappointed because it was so good\n",
            "Everything here worked for me, and I’ve never had a core pint that didn’t go all the way down to the bottom. The brownie and ice cream flavor and texture are perfect. My only issue is that the core itself tastes more like thick fudge than brownie. Delicious for sure but I was hoping for more a brownie batter than fudge flavor, as the pint labeling suggests.\n",
            "My pint has about 3/4 chocolate and 1/4 vanilla. Which is just as well, as the vanilla has no flavor and seems more like ice milk. I tried a bite by itself because I've read that B&J makes one of the best vanilla ice creams. Now I'm wondering if this is the same as the vanilla pints, or perhaps a lesser quality is used here, since there's a lot of other stuff going on to mask it. My first thought upon trying the chocolate side was \"coconut oil.\" That's always disappointing as it's a rather prominent flavor. The core is good and gooey with a taste more of syrup than batter. I tried this as the store was out of the one I wanted. In the future I'll stick to the really good ones.\n",
            "I just bought this flavor while at Walmart the other day as a treat for the stressful week before finals. I usually get the cheapest ice cream at Walmart but figured I could splurge. I love brownie batter but found that the \"brownie batter core\" tasted nothing like brownie batter. Instead, the core was just like a chocolate fudge syrup. The description also states there would be half vanilla and half chocolate ice cream with brownie chunks surrounding the core. More than 3/4 of the ice cream in my container was chocolate. Sorry Ben & Jerry's, definitely not as good as expected.\n",
            "I was looking for something sweet to eat , and ran into it , the ice cream was great except for the fact that the core disappeared . The ice cream was enjoyable until it was about half way gone . My pint also had very few brownie bites . Don't get me wrong it was delicious, i just expect core to last longer & a little more brownie bites !\n",
            "Brownie Batter was my favorite flavor maybe 15 years ago. It's was heaven on a spoon. Then it disappeared and i was lost.\n",
            "When I saw this one, I was super excited that it might be close to heaven as I knew it. The brownie pieces are yummy, but the gooey batter \"core\" almost ruins this pint. It's not brownie batter at all, it's a very sweet and almost artificial chocolate syrup that would be better left out. I wish i could use more delicious words to describe this flavor, but I can't lie, it's a disappointment, sorry guys!\n",
            "It had been awhile since I had given in to my B&J's craving. I saw this flavor and was curious about the core. The first 1/3 of the pint was good, but not even halfway through the core disappeared and I was left with basically vanilla and chocolate ice cream. It was also definitely lacking in brownie pieces. A little disappointed.\n",
            "The first several bites were really good (despite there not being any brownie pieces in the first 1/4 of the pint). The brownie batter was really good and it was overflowing but then about half way thru the pint, the brownie batter stopped. And then nothing. From then on it was just chocolate and vanilla ice cream with an occasional brownie piece. This could be a really great flavor if it was made correctly.\n",
            "I loved this flavor!! I’ve never had a “core” flavor before and the core was my absolute favorite part until it was gone half way threw the pint leaving a hole on the side .. Not to sure if I’ll be buying a “core” flavor again..\n",
            "This is my all time favorite flavor of ben and jerrys. Though everytime i get ot, the core stops about 1/3 of the way down. I didnt mind that too much but my most recent stopped about half way.\n",
            "I’ve always loved this flavor, but this has become my least favorite. I just bought a pint of this today and it’s dried out. No brownie batter core. I’m highly disappointed.\n",
            "I was so excited to see this! But as suspected the core didn't reach the bottom and 1/3 of it was AMAZING. The rest just regular ice cream. A waste of 6 dollars.\n",
            "I don’t know who needs to hear this but you deserve ice cream (or your favorite non-dairy alternative) because it may help you temporarily forget about climate change, I recommend this one because it’s basically the most amazing thing I’ve ever put in my mouth (and best believe there are many, many close contenders there). This stuff is so perfectly decadent that I almost couldn’t finish a pint of it, which is definitely an accomplishment in my book and I’m the book of anyone who’s witnessed me inhale a whole pint of green tea ice cream on a regular day.\n",
            "I was slightly disappointed but there are good flavors. I wish it had more whole brownies and the core should go down to the bottom of the pint. Has lots of potential if tweaked.\n",
            "Ok y’all 2 star ppl need to hush about the core! Its sooo good the chocolate and vanilla and brownies! The core is just an added bonus! Loves it\n",
            "I decided to get this core flavor (my publix was all out of my favorite flavors) and I had never had any of the core ice creams before. I was disappointed to say the least, the core was non existent and seemed to go missing towards the middle, and the brownie bits when I found them were absolutely dreadful. Overall I was very disappointed and had to throw it away after being grossed out by the core and brownie flavors. Please do something about these two, the ice cream itself was on point, but the brownie bits and batter need a flavor overhaul.\n",
            "The first time I bought this flavor I was so hopeful, because brownie batter is my favorite b&J's flavor of all time, but I got my pint home and there was hardly any core in it (as the other reviews have mentioned). For that reason I hadn't repurchased until last week when I was desperate bc nothing else at the store sounded good, and lo and behold there was core all the way through!!! So much core in fact, that I questioned if I'd run out of ice cream before core!! (It was close, but I worked diligently to conquer a perfectly balanced core to ice cream ratio from start to finish. Still doesn't compare to the original brownie batter, but I'm so glad you all resolved this coreless issue so many had encountered. Reviewers, your voice was heard!\n",
            "I am an extreme chocolate lover. Usual Half-Baked is my go to, especially now with the Froyo option. The Brownie Batter Core has great potential, however the taste of the “brownie batter” is not great. I honestly don’t even know what to compare it to. The core was also gone mid-way through the ice cream as if they pour it all on top then forgot about the rest of the pint. There also were many brownie bits, it was essentially a pint of chocolate and vanilla ice cream swirled together and that was it. Quite disappointing.\n",
            "This is one of the best ice cream flavors I've ever had (I'm hard to impress). I was loving the brownie core it was delicious! Until... it was gone, I wasn't even half way through the pint. I wish it lasted to the end. Regardless I loved it & will be buying it again. Hopefully, the core will be all the way through next time.\n",
            "I happen to love actual brownie batter and got so excited that I opened it up so fast as soon as I got home and was so disappointed with the brownie batter core, its not brownie batter, its just water down chocolate fudge flavor. The chocolate and vanilla combination was good with the brownie pieces, but I wouldn't call it brownie. I think the factory should work on this flavor more and make it brownie, not chocolate fudge flavor, or just rename it.\n",
            "Like some other reviewers, the core in this carton was sparse. What I did manage to get was soo delicious and chocolately, however halfway through the carton, the core was missing! Please think about adding more core to this ice cream, it is the best part\n",
            "I found this by accident as one day I couldnt find my second fave \"Milk and Cookies\". I love that there's a great flavor that combines vanilla and chocolate ice cream without nuts, but with some brownie pieces. Legitimately, this is my favorite ice cream across all brands, and now I don't even buy other brands, since I've fallen for this flavor. They no longer carry this flavor at my neighborhood store, so I'm forced to buy it at Target...which is ok with me :-)\n",
            "It's more of a dessert than an ice cream. Really full and rich.\n",
            "I bought this ice cream expecting a mix of chocolate and vanilla ice cream with brownie bits and a brownie batter core, unfortunately upon opening the container the brownie batter core was right at the top and make a mess, also the texture of the brownie batter was more like runny chocolate sauce than brownie batter, which was the biggest disappointment for me, also there were not many brownie chunks throughtout the vanilla and chocolate ice cream.\n",
            "I am a hardcore chocolate brownie (anything brownie) ice cream fan. This... this is my fave Ben & Jerry's so far. I haven't had any problems with the core not hitting the bottom. I think the vanilla ice cream adds a nice balance to the overall chocolatey-ness (is that a word?) Anywho, Ben & Jerry's, a sincere thank you from the bottom of this girl's brownie lovin' heart.\n",
            "This was my first time purchasing this flavor and although the ice cream itself was really good, the core flavor was a bit disappointing compared to the other core flavors I normally get. The brownie batter core didn't go all the way to the bottom, and it was very bitter and tasted like artificial fudge. The core itself was the only thing wrong with the ice cream, everything else tasted amazing. I love the brownie and vanilla ice cream.\n",
            "Oh no! There can be too much of a good thing and this flavor proves it. Chocolate Therapy manages to be ooey-gooey and over the top chocolate mayhem without being intensely sweet. The same cannot be said for its chocolate cored partner-in-crime, brownie chunked friend. If you can figure out a way to temper the evil Dr. Sugar, you may have a winner. If not, consign it to the graveyard to spare humanity.\n",
            "Let me start by saying I'm a die hard blue bell lover.\n",
            "But this ice cream is my new number one, it is always perfect from top to bottom. If there was a way to get it without the brownie piece's that would be hands down the best! The flavors of the chocolate and vanilla mixed with the brownie core are perfection! The only thing to make it better would be if it came in a bigger container.\n",
            "I eat this flavor at least 4 times a week but I'm getting tired of the core missing or very little. I have read reviews going back 2017. Clearly this is something being done for cost reasons. Easy adjustment at the factory to fix this problem or replace the person in charge. The chocolate cookie core ice cream also has a very small core. I'm going to find a new gourmet brand of ice cream.\n",
            "Didn't realize that icecream this good existed, unfortunately there was an air bubble at the bottom that robbed me of a fair chance at happiness. I'd also like to add that this has one of the lowest ratings on here yet when I went back to the store to get more, it was all sold out. So if yall are giving low rating to keep ppl away I fear its too late.\n",
            "This is definitely among my go-to Ben&Jerry’s flavors. The gooey chocolately brownie batter is perfect to really treat yourself after a long week. And I love that the actual icecream isnt overly sweet so that once the batter gets to be too much I can give my taste buds a refreshing break. Seriously its so decadent and I always have a craving for this\n",
            "This one is by far my favorite, but it has a terrible draw back! The Core is supposed to be the best part, don't get me wrong it is, but it is a small part that should be alot more than just a bite. At the bottom its just chocolate and vanilla ice cream. I just wish the browies and core were all throughout the pint like it is advertised.\n",
            "I am SO DISAPPOINTED. I'm sick and sent my bf to the store for ice cream and got the brownie core... it's so freezer burned I don't even want to bother with it! I've never had the brownie core so this is really disappointing. Not to mention it mentions fudge brownies in it and I have not found a single one. I'm giving up on it.\n",
            "I buy this regularly as it is my favourite flavour. However, on multiple occasions of me buying this the core has been pretty disappointing. I find that the never really seems to go down to the bottom or even halfway. It’s more like a fat blob at the top and nothing more. Overall, it tastes very nice but the core lets it down.\n",
            "I kept hearing so much great things about Ben & Jerry's ice cream flavors. This is the first one I ever tried and it was disappointing. I was really looking forward to have brownie pieces but I think I found like 2. The rest were like crumbs. The core was barely there too. I'll try another one but this wasn't worth it to me.\n",
            "I’m new to Ben n Jerry’s and so far have gotten 2 brown batter cores and 1 chocolate fudge brownie. I absolutely love the flavors but the cores for both didn’t go all the way down and for the fudge brownie, there weren’t any fudge brownie pieces until I reached the halfway point so it was kind of disappointing\n",
            "This is the best ice cream flavor, and the core is the best part. But halfway through the core just stopped, and it's very disappointing since getting the gooey core in every bite is what makes this ice cream the best ice cream there is! Seriously just needs the core all the way through!\n",
            "This is hands down my favourite flavour. The only way it could be improved is by replacing the vanilla ice cream with more chocolate haha! BUT the Australian Ben and Jerry's has stopped selling it here so now it exists only in my dreams..... No other flavour matches up in my opinion\n",
            "I just had this flavor last night! The core was so thick and gooey just like brownie batter! My core ran all the way to the bottom. I had lots of brownie chunks in mine and they were delicious and chewy!!!! Best ice cream I have ever had. If you're a brownie lover, eat this.\n",
            "Fudge Brownie is my absolute favorite flavor as well as the boom chocalata cookie core one so I decided this flavor would be the holy grail!! But only 1/3 of the pint had the core part opposed to the other flavors that I’ve tried having core in the whole pint! Why is this?\n",
            "I love several flavors of Ben and jerrys ice cream I just recently tried this flavor and fell in love but all 3 pints I have eaten i too have missed the core not even half way through. It ls amazing but not near as amazing without the core!!! Definitely needs more!!!\n",
            "It’s hard to ever give a bad review on Ben and Jerry’s ice cream, but I am going to try. As far as brownie goes, I only got little hints, but the core was great. The brownie flavor was good, just not enough of it. As always, the ice cream was still very enjoyable.\n",
            "I love this ice cream!! I have actually never had a problem with the core because whenever I buy these the core goes all the way to the bottom. Anyway if you like chocolate and vanilla and brownies separately you’re gonna LOVE them all together with this flavor!\n",
            "Man, I wanted to love this but I was completely disappointed by the core which did not go all the way to the bottom (not to mention the lack of brownie pieces). Ugh, Ben and Jerry’s, please fix ASAP as this pint has the potential to knock it out of the park!\n",
            "The first and only time i’ve had it i absolutely loved it. Im impatiently waiting for my local publix to restock it i might try my local walmart to see if they have it though. i ate it on it for 2 days and i couldnt get enough of it. it’s my new favorite!!!\n",
            "I love this flavor, but I've gotten it twice and both times the core has disappeared about halfway through the pint. I haven't had this issue with other core flavors, so it seems to be unique to this flavor. It would be perfect if it reached the bottom!\n",
            "I buy brownie batter core about 3-4 times a week and for about the past month every batch has dried out brownies and it’s literally disgusting. Haven’t had a good batch in a month! And i hate chocolate and this actually made me like chocolate.\n",
            "This is a great ice cream. The only negative is the brownie batter core only goes 3/4s the way down. Leaving the 1/4 usually going the dog. Still well worth the purchase. Thank you guys for making the best ice cream in the world.\n",
            "The year 2017 has been all about Brownie Batter when l find it on Sale l buy all the store has twice. Unfortunately, l have to have one every night and my weight shows it. So, l decided to give up food so l could have my ice cream.\n",
            "Tried this out hoping for a little bit of a variety in the chocolate and vanilla taste. All I got was a bland chocolate with not much else. If the texture and chocolate flavor itself had even a slight variation it would be ok.\n",
            "I decided to try a new flavor and while the flavor was delicious, the core did not go to the bottom of the container. It ended about 2/3 of the way down which was disappointing because that was the best part of the ice cream.\n",
            "Please tell me why the brownie core is probably the worst taking brownie batter possible? First of all the viscosity is wayyyy off! No brownie batter is that this/ taste like the fakest chocolate on earth. Never getting again\n",
            "I don’t know why this one is rated around only 3 1/2 - 4 stars, it is honestly so good! It’s basically a hot fudge sundae mixed with brownies. Honestly one of their best flavors, I absolutely love it, and recommend highly\n",
            "This is probably my second favorite out of the Cores. I love brownies and I love Brownie batter so this was a win for me! The vanilla balances it all out so it won't be too much chocolate. I hope they keep this flavor.\n",
            "This is my fave flavor. The core tastes more like fudge than brownie batter, but I love it! Sometimes the core doesn't always go all the way to the bottom though, wish it would! Aside from that, I could live off it.\n",
            "I bought this one after not seeing the brownie batter flavor out anymore, which was clearly made with real brownie batter. This tastes more like and has the texture of a brownie that went soggy then got froze :(\n",
            "Pretty good ice cream but overall could be better executed. I love most of the core ice cream lines even though each series seems to be a re-run of previous series. Still a good product and will buy in a pinch.\n",
            "I loved loved the bites that had some of the core or brownie bits. Sadly, those bites were limited. The core was short lived and I maybe found 2 brownie bites. It was more just vanilla and chocolate ice cream.\n",
            "This is the second pint that I’ve bought and both times there was no brownie batter core. Just small amounts here and there. The ice cream was still good but I was looking forward to the brownie batter core!\n",
            "I love this ice cream and am so thankful you brought it back from the B&J graveyard. I know it's a little different blend the original Brownie Batter but the flavor is just as good. Don't ever go away again!\n",
            "I agree with several of the other reviews. The flavor was great, but really disappointed in the lack of the core that was in my container!! It was very thin and ran out half way through the container.\n",
            "I knew I was taking a chance on this bc of the mixed reviews. The core only went 1/3 of the way thru and the brownie chunks were too hard. I love Ben & Jerry's but I'm disappointed with this one.\n",
            "Was very excited to try this flavor since I love chewy bits in my ice cream but there were very few brownies bits and the core was barely in there. Disappointed because I wanted to love it:(\n",
            "I have never found a combination as amazing as this one. It's got everything I want. Chocolate, vanilla, brownie chunks and a fantastic brownie batter to amplify its flavour. I love it!\n",
            "I have tried several of the core flavors and this is my favorite by far! It is a chocolate lovers dream. The brownie batter core is so decadent, and I love the brownie chunks!\n",
            "Great ice cream flavors but the core ratio is horrible its more Like a topping. The same for the karamel sutra core is gone before you even get to the middle of the pint\n",
            "Great ice cream, as usual from Ben & Jerry's, but the core was only in the top third of the pint. Too bad, it really made this flavor work. Just not enough of it.\n",
            "So good I haven't been able to find it since! I have gone to multiple stores and still nothing... but i wil pmm remain diligent..ty for making my mouth happy!\n",
            "I bought 2 pints at once. First pint was perfect. The second had maybe 4 pieces of brownie in it. (Which is the best part for me) I was highly disappointed!\n",
            "I love chocolate. Especially dark chocolate. If you love chocolate as well - get this ice cream. The vanilla mixed in is the perfect amount.\n",
            "LOVE THIS FLAVOR!!! But the core doesn’t reach past the top third, you miss brownie batter towards the end of the pint. Bit of a bummer :(\n",
            "Started wonderfully at the top--lots of core but 1/3 down the core was barely visible--DISAPPOINTED--started so good WHAT HAPPENED???\n",
            "I love this flavor, it’s my absolute favorite. It’s literally a mix of brownie batter and ice cream together. What could be better\n",
            "I'm extremely disappointed as I love the flavor but I only got a few bites of the core and it was gone before I was even halfway!!\n",
            "As a whole it was really good but the core disappeared after literally 3 bites, it didn't go even close to 1/4 of the way down.\n",
            "for the most part this does not disappoint unfortunately today i got 4 spoons in and the core was gone!!!!! I need more CORE!!!\n",
            "I get this ice cream SEVERAL times a week it’s great but the last two times I got it the core ended after the first bite!\n",
            "I loved this ice cream and I would have it again, but there wasn't really much core in it... was kinda disappointing\n",
            "The core was too much and the ice cream didn't have the chunky goodness I've come to expect from Ben and Jerry's\n",
            "I got this 2 weeks ago and I loved the flavor. Love the core it's so tasty. I will buy it again repeatedly.\n",
            "Probably one of my favorite flavors but not even halfway through the pint and the core was completely gone!\n",
            "I BOUGHT THIS LAST WEEK AND IVE NEVER BEEN MORE IN LOVE W AN ICE CREAM. THAT BROWNIE BATTER IS BEAUTIFUL\n",
            "Um... Ben, Jerry, MY DUDES. This is heaven in a pint. Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you go.\n",
            "The core didn't taste anything like brownie batter. It just tasted like fudge sauce. Disappointed!\n",
            "You get both vanilla and chocolate with brownie chuncks and a fudge batter in the middle. Love it!\n",
            "I really like the combination and really wanted more brownie batter in the core. Keep it up. YUM!\n",
            "I was just introduced to Cora ice cream, and as someone who loves brownie batter, I love this!!!\n",
            "This is definitely my go to flavor, with the peanut butter core coming in very close second...\n",
            "I love this flavor of ice cream but every time I’ve bought it, the core runs out halfway :(\n",
            "This is my go to flavor. It is the perfect blend of vanilla, chocolate, and brownie bites.\n",
            "The brownie batter core had a chemical taste to it. It was VERY sweet and acrid.\n",
            "Core should be filled all the way to the bottom but it's still amazing.\n",
            "This is my favorite flavor, it's a perfect mix of chocolate and vanilla\n",
            "There never enough,never goes to the bottom but Hase the best taste!\n",
            "I go through the pint so fast when I buy it, you should make quarts!\n",
            "Love the fudge, nice and gooey. Perfect for a chocoholic like me.\n",
            "Always has been my favorite flavor to eat. Make sure you keep it.\n",
            "I love anything brownie and this is great. The core is delicious.\n",
            "I love that ice cream it was so good Loved it Will buy it again\n",
            "This is by far the best ice cream I've ever had. So good.\n",
            "It tastes so good! I love it, it’s one of my favorites\n",
            "The brownie batter core is the best. Unbeatable flavor\n",
            "It's my favorite it's simple but very delicious!!!\n",
            "I'm 8 months pregnant and this was all I wanted so I walked all the way across town to buy it at the grocery store. It's super expensive there but I HAD to have it. I've never been so happy in my whole life. I want this ice cream everywhere in my life from now on.\n",
            "If Jesus made ice cream, and not, like, carpenter-y things, he would make this. If God made this ice cream, I promise he wouldn't have bothered with the rest of creation. He'd just sit on his God couch and get wicked fat eating this all the time, except there wouldn't be time, because you know... no creation needed after the crowning achievement of the cheesecake core. Yup.\n",
            "I was in a bad mood all day, nothing was going right, was so stressed out, was watching my weight. Just a typical mom having a bad day, well late that night went in the fridge, and wanted to try the ice cream I got, never have I tried it before, can I say I couldn't put this down. This made me in such a happy mood, I can't stop telling my husband and everyone else about this delicious ice cream, it was so good that I went and got another. I hope I don't get too big, that's my worry now! Try this flavor ONLY\n",
            "if you like cheesecake and cookies and cream ice cream, I promise you, you will love it. Thanx again for making this one. Great job! P.s. I'm super picky!\n",
            "I had this at a sample at Winco & since then We've purchased about 2 pints per week. & we're not typically ice cream people. This is THE BEST ice cream creation ever. The cookies & cream with chunks of cheesecake make this such a wonderful combo of dessert. & prior to this, I would only eat\n",
            "Dryer's rocky road when I eat ice cream or Venchi gelato in Italy. But now, I am in love w Ben & Jerry's.\n",
            "The description of the is ice cream says it includes chocolate cookies. Per the graphic on top of the pint lid, the cookies are supposed to be distributed throughout the whole pint. To my surprise, while I was eating this ice cream their were ZERO cookies on the cheesecake side and only a few on the chocolate side. As a seasoned Ben and Jerry’s eater, I was highly disappointed.\n",
            "Like most other reviewers, I am a huge Ben and Jerry’s fan and will be through good and not so good pints. I really didn’t like this one. The ice cream was grainy on both sides and the cheesecake ice cream was not so tasty and I ate around it. The chocolate side was good, albeit not smooth. The cheesecake core tasted great but it was very hard and there was very little of it. I ended up throwing half the pint away. Oh well, onto another new Ben and Jerry’s flavor to try.\n",
            "This is the best flavor of B&Js I've found so far. I can't do nuts or bananas and this one is excellent and won't kill me!\n",
            "Can't stop eating it once I've started!!! It's the best. Only wish there was a little more cheesecake filling it's so tasty!!!\n",
            "I got this at Walmart and it was epic! The chocolate ice cream is sweet and the cheesecake ice cream tastes similar to vanilla. The chocolate cookies add a really good crunch and texture to the creamy ice cream. The core was the bomb though. It tastes exactly like actual cheesecake and is rich and dense. I 100% APPROVE THIS FLAVOR TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE.\n",
            "I was so excited to find this flavor! I was then disappointed by a very artificially tasting attempt at cheesecake for the ice cream and the core tasted more like thick baking glaze with too much confectioners sugar. Very disappointing. The chocolate ice cream and the cookie pieces were yummy though.\n",
            "I was excited to buy this when I saw it. I love cheesecake! I love cookies and cream! Great combo especially in a core Ben and jerry's. I was sorely disappointed. Don't get me wrong. The ice cream was good but... it was literally cookies and cream ice cream with a vanilla core. Vanilla. Core. That was it. No cream cheese. No cream cheese core. Nothing. Just vanilla ice cream. Very very disappointing.\n",
            "Aloha from Hawaii! Lol, I always get this flavor when I'm at the store and this would TOTALLY get 5 stars if there was just a liiiiittle bit more cheesecake in the middle! I love scooping some of the middle with some ice cream around it, just wish there was more core!\n",
            "I like this!!!! I like this!!!! I like this!!!!I like this!!!!\n",
            "I bought this flavor a couple months ago, and never again. Cheesecake is one of my favorite flavors, but this just doesn't taste like cheesecake. It doesn't taste bad, but definitely a weaker flavor in the core line up.\n",
            "I love this ice cream. However, it is sometimes a little disappointing to get close to the bottom and see there is no more core left. I buy it 2-3 time a week and sometimes the amount of cheesecake core is a little low. I love this flavor so much, please don't short the core!\n",
            "Do not ever discontinue this flavor. I plan on snacking on this when I'm pregnant in a few years. Good stuff.\n",
            "Love it; The best ice cream ever! Just delicious.\n",
            "I was at my local grocery store, wasn't really planning on buying ice cream and there was a special. I love cheesecake and in my old age I am loving chocolate ice cream and cookies more and more. Well you get all of this in one pint. Real cheesecake. I meant to take one bite to just taste it and oops, just like that it was gone. I had to go buy more.\n",
            "I'm not a fan of ice cream. This flavor is the best ice cream I've ever had. My favorite part is the cheesecake core. If anything, I wish it was distributed more evenly. Usually towards the bottom, there is little to no cheesecake left. You've converted me, this ice cream is great.\n",
            "So I've been eating this specific one for about a month or two once or twice a week. Meaning I would eat like 1-2 pints a week LOL if you love ice cream try this flavor. All of their ice creams\n",
            "Are to die for in general.\n",
            "I got a pint of this tonight and was super disappointed with how little of the core was. It tasted amazing but it didn’t last throughout and was pretty disappointing.\n",
            "But needs more core! Why does it end not even half way unlike the other cores, the cheese cake core is the best part and best core, pleeeaseeee more core!\n",
            "Please.\n",
            "Don't ever take this away. It is the greatest flavor since you discontinued my Fudge Central\n",
            "I buy one twice a month so delicious the cheesecake core is the best !\n",
            "My new favorite flavor. The flavor was amazing. Absolutely love it\n",
            "the cheesecake? the cookies? is the best it really slaps\n",
            "I'm the type of person to never write a review, especially when it's for some ice cream... As i put the first spoon in my mouth i waited for the great taste of Ben & Jerry's but instead got the weakest flavor i think i've ever tasted. If this was repackaged and sold as a single spoon of nesquik in a gallon of water flavour i might have actually thought twice about paying for this super overpriced rubbish. It's not like i went into it wanting it to be bad. I'm the least fussy eater i know, and i don't think i've ever disliked Ben & Jerry's, or ice cream in general. It's not that the flavour is bad it's just so weak. The bargain supermarket brand chocolate ice cream tasted more like chocolate than this. Also the core tastes about as much like cheese cake as Gatorade tastes like almond milk... Guess what it doesn't. This ice cream is great if you find mayonnaise spicy. 0/10.\n",
            "I bought this and my core didn’t even start at the top. Then when it did appear it was only about 1 inch down and then dissapeared. It wasn’t even in the middle!! Do not buy this, I bought this for the core and it wasn’t even there. It was a decent flavor though.\n",
            "Tried this a few days ago because the store I went to never had the flavors I would normally buy (Phish Food or Cherry Garcia). I was bummed until I tasted it!! Oooh my gosh, this is my new obsession!!! It’s so good. Like someone else said, I wish it had a little more filling in the center just because it’s so delicious!! This ice cream is so addictive!\n",
            "I don't really buy ice cream maybe a cake once s year for a friend or family but my aunt was food shopping there was a sale she grabbed me this flavor I love cheesecake OMG I tell myself little bit put it away for later lol before I knew it I was at the bottom I'm happy to report I buy ice cream now and have 3 of these in my freezer\n",
            "My son and I love this! We purchased it because I accidentally grabbed it along with the brownie core by mistake. The best mistake I ever made. A friend bought me the Ben and Jerry’s Ice-cream Dessert book, can’t wait to try. Loved reading the story of how the two of you persevered and didn’t give up.\n",
            "Really an amazing core! I love it! The mocha ice cream is delicious! I wish they had a tub of the mocha, the vanilla is just ok! The cookie chunks are a bit different then the usual chucks they've done in other batches, but overall. This flavor is amazing.\n",
            "It was good, but it wasn't a favorite. It didn't wow me like the others. It's the only Ben & Jerry's flavor (out of all the flavors I tried) that I only had once. I didn't buy it again, only because the others were so good. I still liked it though.\n",
            "I tried this one on a whim today. My all time favorite is the Salted Caramel Core. But I must say, this one is pretty great too. The chunks of cookie throughout and the cheesecake core from top to bottom makes this a delight through and through.\n",
            "So happy I picked out this flavor at the store! It is great. I love that it has half chocolate ice cream and half vanilla. The cheesecake core gives it even better flavor. I will definitely buy this flavor again.\n",
            "I love every flavor I have ever had and I have had A LOT of flavors. My absolute favorite is the \"Cookies & Cream Cheesevake core\" now I can not find it anywhere!! But all Ben & Jerrys are awesime!!!\n",
            "If you ever discontinue the Cookies and Cream Cheesecake Core, I will light myself on fire and throw myself off of the Golden Gate Bridge. Do you want to be responsible for that? No? Excellent.\n",
            "Thr cheesecake core is heavenly. My only complaint is my local grocery store has stopped carrying it or sold out. It's been several weeks. Fingers crossed they will get it back in stock soon.\n",
            "Please make this better :(\n",
            "Usually my go-to ice cream but something about the last one i bought was too icy and lost major flavor. Very little cookie pieces and small amount of core.\n",
            "This flavor is amazing! I love it, when I have started eat that ice cream i couldn't stop. I was eating eating and eating. This taste made me happy. You have to try it!\n",
            "I have tried a lot of flavors but this one beat them all, so delicious! The cheesecake core is out of this world. This is the only flavor I buy now. Perfection!\n",
            "I bought this as a gift for my teacher as I had been trying to get him to eat some for four months. He took one bite and he was an instant Ben and Jerry's fan\n",
            "Usually my go-to ice cream but something about the last one i bought was too icy and lost major flavor. Very little cookie pieces and small amount of core.\n",
            "This is literally the best Ben and jerry's flavor ever. I don't know who came up with a cheesecake core, but they derserve a nobel peace prize.\n",
            "Super amazing flavor - one of my favorites! The ‘cookies’ are not too chunky or hard and the cheesecake creates a mouthwatering experience.\n",
            "Tried this ben and jerry's for the first time and have not touched any other ice cream flavor since. Hands down the best\n",
            "It’s the perfect combination. Wish they added a little more cheesecake core though. Always seems to end too soon! Haha\n",
            "My husband and I were fighting over this ice cream even though it was MINE! Very good, and a unquestionable favorite!\n",
            "I recently started to eat it for a while but haven't seen it in Walmart for a long time. I enjoy eating this flavor.\n",
            "Vanilla always compliments chocolate and with the cookies and cheesecakes just makes it outta this world!\n",
            "I've tried almost all of them and this is the one I crave I crave the most. OMG, sooooo gooood!\n",
            "Love! Love! Love!\n",
            "Delicious flavor. Cream Cheese is not overly sweet. Love the cookies too.\n",
            "This is by far my favorite ice cream of all time and does not disappoint.\n",
            "Please bring this to England. I had it in Arkansas and I dream about it.\n",
            "It contains everything i love dessert wise\n",
            "Amazing comfort food\n",
            "L I T E R A L L Y HEAVEN IN A CUP IM IN LOVE WITH THIS\n",
            "Best flavor yet..... for real each bite is a dream\n",
            "So, this is by far the best ice cream we've ever had. Like, literally the best one. I like the vanilla, husband likes the chocolate and we fight over the core. It gets intense.\n",
            "I've read all the reviews and they are correct the core does not go all the way through this product it is more like a caramel plug. Was disappointed\n",
            "I love this so much that I’ve honestly considered moving to VT to work in the factory so I can be so close to the creation of pure goodness. The only possible way to improve this would be to invent a time machine that comes with it so you can always go back and taste it for the first time and see the moment your life changes.\n",
            "I bought this from Publix a few days ago and I loved it, until I noticed the core stopped half way through. It was very disappointing, the caramel core was my favorite part :(\n",
            "I tried this and i love the combination, im just disappointed in the caramel \" core\" . I wish it went all the way to the bottom and not just half way through.\n",
            "The caramel flavored ice cream is ok--it would be better as vanilla. But the combination of the chocolate flavor, the chocolate chunks, and the soft caramel core is delightful!! The only problem is that the caramel core *always* stops halfway through the pint, rendering the other half of the pint completely and totally worthless. The last pint I got, my boyfriend grabbed one small bowl of it, and there was no caramel left at all after that--there should be way more caramel since this flavor can really only be enjoyed by one person, one time before the rest of the pint is ready to be tossed. Again, good flavor, but poor execution. I would highly recommend it if there were more than a dollop of caramel.\n",
            "I used to love this but the last few times ive bought a tub the core stops halfway down! :-( so disappointing as the core is the best bit. The bottom half of the tub is boring! Wont be buying it anymore.\n",
            "This is my favorite flavor. I love the Caramel ice cream with the caramel core and the chocolate ice cream with the chocolate chunks. But the last two times I have bought this the chocolate chunks have been in the caramel ice and not the chocolate ice cream. So you can’t the caramel ice cream flavor and I’ve have very disappointed. I hope this isn’t the new normal and it’s just a quality control issue.\n",
            "Bought this for the first time expecting the core to go all the way down. It didn’t, it stopped about 1/4 of the way in. So I did research and i found it was meant to go all the down so again I bought it along with a friend who also bought the same and to our disappointment the core AGAIN stopped 1/4 of the way in. I only purchased it for the caramel centre therefore will not be buying again as I do not want just chocololate ice cream. As the was 2/3 chocolate ice cream 1/3 caramel ice cream.\n",
            "PLEASE MAKE A DAIRY FREE VERSION! I've loved this since high school when it first came out however I am lactose intolerant and it has gotten worse with age lol I love all of Ben&Jerry's dairy free products though, keep it up! :)\n",
            "Obviosly when you read all reviews it becomes clear that it is not your intentions to have the core go all the way to the bottom. Considering how much they cost, that is really not okay. Other than that (which is quite major though), the icecream is good but the chocolate ice cream lacks a lot of taste and is quite hard and not at all as creamy as the caramel one. It could be amazing, but you have a lot to fix.\n",
            "I've frequently purchased the karamel sutra core iced cream from ben and jerry's, so when i bought one to find there was absolutely no caramel, as in not even a single drop of caramel in the pint, i was highly disappointed. I've seen alot of other comments from people having similar experiences with karamel sutra ranging from only 1/2 the amount of caramel the pint should have all the way to what i experienced which was absolutely no caramel. Ben and Jerry's definitely makes some good iced cream, but they need some serious quality control.\n",
            "Being gluten free it's difficult to find great flavors in ice cream. I was disappointed that the caramel didn't go to the bottom, the whole reason I purchased the ice cream.\n",
            "I would like to continue buying the GF flavors and really hope you can add the caramel to the entire pint!\n",
            "Maybe some coupons will inspire me to try this flavor again!\n",
            "I bought a pint a few days ago and was super excited to try a new flavor! The ice-cream itself was delicious as always, but there was only a tiny bit of caramel at the top of the pint. The \"core\" aspect of this ice-cream was nonexistent. I think this was just a fluke, but for 5 bucks, it was disappointing.\n",
            "Yesterday we just bought a pint of this from an Earth Fare grocery. It is well within date, and the chocolate and vanilla ice creams inside were nice. BUT the supposed \"core\" of caramel was no more than a tablespoon-sized dollop at the top. No more caramel in the whole pint if \"karamel\" sutra ice cream.\n",
            "... it was all caramel ice cream with the caramel core. The chocolate half is delicious but it overpowers the caramel ice cream. Also, I wish I knew what brand or how B&J makes their caramel. I could eat that alone! I always purchase this flavor. Wouldn’t trade it for anything.\n",
            "I have been eating this since it came out and love it! Recently moved to NW Minnesota from the east coast and no one sells it here! I was literally crushed because I thought it was discontinued like my other old favorite That's My Jam, was. I finally found one random pint of it today and I am so excited to try it.\n",
            "This is absolutely my favorite flavor as of now. The only problem is the caramel core doesn't go all the way to the bottom. How disappointing! The one I just finished the caramel core barely went halfway down. Other than that, it is absolutely delicious.\n",
            "Just indulged a small tub of this but the caramel ran and bits and stopped im the middle. Wasn't all the way through in the centre. Really wish I had the perfect balance each time instead of only chocolate and caramel icecream and no centre\n",
            "The core does not go all the way through and is truly disappointing because that's why I buy this! It stops about a third of the way through. Second time in a row recently this has happened.\n",
            "First, I love Ben and Jerrys. And I love all these flavors, the core is great. But it ended like a quarter of the way into the pint, which was disappointing cause it was the best part.\n",
            "Brought this last night, flavour is amazing, just a shame that the core only goes down half way. Considering they cost $13 each here in Australia, not happy.\n",
            "The caramel ice cream half is amazing but the chocolate doesn't have enough flavour and the caramel core stops halfway. Salted caramel core is way better.\n",
            "This flavor is absolutely amazing and they really load up on the caramel. It is a perfect treat. I would give it more stars if I could.\n",
            "This ice cream is great for the first half, but there’s no caramel core in the bottom half. Major disappointment.\n",
            "The last 3-4 times I've purchased, the core stops mid, or 2/3 of the way through.\n",
            "the core does not go all the way to the bottom. It stops maybe half way through.\n",
            "I just bought this today, from Publix and felt compelled to leave a review. This ice cream is perfect for those that only stick to one kind of thing, but want to venture out and try something new. Karamel Sutra, is that new exciting flavor that has familiar vibes. Which is why I decided to try it. I haaaaaate trying new ice creams. But as good as this one is, I feel like I’m missing out of a world of flavors! I excited to buy again and then try some other flavors.\n",
            "Everytime I get this one, it doesn't have the carmel center :(\n",
            "I have been faithfully addicted to Karamel Sutra since it was originally introduced. At times it is difficult to find. I have tried other flavors and brands and nothing comes close to this decadent delight. Karamel Sutra Core isn’t just an incredible taste; you dream of it, and fantasize there is more as you reach the bottom. When I finish one, I can’t wait to go buy another. Karamel Sutra rocks you to the core as an unforgettable experience.\n",
            "I bought two Ben & Jerrys Karamel Sutra and both were missing the Soft caramel core. Such a disappointment im so sad, I eat the Karamel sutra all the time and im very upset. =/\n",
            "I'm in Nashville, TN and I'm being told by the local stores that Karmal Sutra is no longer being produced. I am devastated by this news as Karmal Sutra is the most amazing ice cream that I have ever tasted and it is the only one that I eat. Say it ain't so! Please tell me there'd an error somewhere and let me know how I can still partake in the wonderful experience of your Karmal Sutra ice cream. Anxiously awaiting to hear from someone.\n",
            "Frankly I don't care if the caramel doesn't go all the way to the bottom - it's very good & there's plenty. And the best part is the chocolate side anyway, love the chocolate bits in it too, but the vanilla is great as well.\n",
            "Karamel Sutra is an incredible blend of creamy, rich flavored ice cream with fudge chunks and mouth watering caramel core. It possesses the power to crush a person’s attempt to diet while making them perfectly happy to do so! While it is fair to say on occasion the caramel core does not reach the bottom of the pint, it won’t stop you from savoring every last bite! Go out and get this ice cream today before I eat it all.\n",
            "Karamel Sutra is by far my most favorite ice cream I have ever had. I would be fine never having any other kind of ice cream. I have honestly had a disgusting amount of this flavor since my discovery. I know sometimes the core doesn't go all the way down, but I just eat a little off the top, then scoop out the rest in one giant scoop and flip it upside down. Then the core can be saved for last!!\n",
            "I love this flavor! Who doesn't want a thick gooey glob of caramel in the middle of their ice cream?! Only problem is about have way through the container the core is no longer there. The first time I thought maybe I just got a bad batch. It happens. Although I'm currently eating my third on (over a few months period of time I promise) and here I'am in the middle of the pint with no more core\n",
            "This stuff... this stuff here. The caramel ice cream does taste like caramel. Rich and creamy like all Ben and Jerry’s. The chocolate side with fudge flakes is my favorite half. But the best part is that thick, sweet caramel core! It’s perfect caramel, flowing like honey through the ice cream, daring me to eat the core out of it and leave the ice cream for seconds. This is GREAT ice cream!!\n",
            "This is the only flavor I've ever been able to find that's gluten free so it's been my go-to for several years... then out of nowhere it has disappeared from the 3 places I have been buying it from. A couple of months ago our Kroger stopped carrying it and then our small local grocery store ran out a few weeks later and last week I went to Whole Foods and thought I had found it but I got home, opened it up and took a bite without paying much attention and it had DISGUSTING Coconut in it. Trust me when I say that gluten free people have their absolute FILL of two flavors in every other thing they eat - almond and coconut - and I absolutely do NOT want it in my ice cream too.\n",
            "This is the best ice cream I’ve ever had. Have to make sure I always have one(or more) in the freezer. The core definitely never reaches the bottom, but I just make sure to push the caramel sound so I can save some for the bottom. Also, sometimes the chips are in the caramel and sometimes they’re in the chocolate?? Confusion! But I will always buy this flavor.\n",
            "The ice cream is pretty good, not very remarkable but not boring as far as caramel-chocolate ice cream flavors go. However, what I can't appreciate is the name and description of the flavor. I don't want to be reminded of s-xual activities whenever I see this product, and I don't want it to create awkward situations between curious children and their parents.\n",
            "I recently purchased this product and it started off good; expect for the fact that the caramel core disappears halfway through. Very disappointed and the caramel ice cream was lacking the caramel, it tasted more like a vanilla ice cream with a tang to it. Please improve your caramel ice cream and add more caramel core.\n",
            "This IS ( period ) the best of the best. Been addicted from the first time I tried it over 10 years & counting. Never had a problem with the caramel core. I will literally go to different stores until I can find it. Crazy me went to 4 stores in a storm. LOL! Some days I have it for breakfast & dinner.\n",
            "I told my husband he should have never brought this ice cream home, because now it is the only ice cream I want! It is absolutely amazing I can’t believe it’s real! It’s dangerous how good it is and it really tests my self control. One request... PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE MAKE A DAIRY FREE VERSION OF THIS!!!\n",
            "This flavor is the BEST. I didn’t even crave ice cream until my mother in law brought this to our table and now, HELP. It’s so good that I can eat a pint in a day. However, I can’t find it anymore! Since moving from Brooklyn, I have not been able to locate this flavor. Has it been discontinued?!?!\n",
            "The blending of flavour inside every pint of this one is so good. I refuses to eat ice cream is not the karamel sutra. Caramel is so soft not too sweet. The chocolate ice cream are so creamy as the caramel ice cream and chocolate tidbits are just bonus that makes this ice cream the best.\n",
            "This ice cream and mixture taste great. It's one of my favorite go tos. I would give it a 5 but the last couple times I've purchased this ice cream the core stops halfway through which is a little disappointing considering that the feature name of its series is \"core\"\n",
            "I was not impressed with Ben & Jerry's ice cream until I saw this flavor and its ingredients. From the first spoonful, I was in love!! The only drawback is that Karamel Sutra's hard to find in my city. So whenever I come across it, I usually buy at least four pints.\n",
            "We have a customer in our store who loves this flavour but has been saying that it is very soft in our freezing. After getting checks on the freezers they are fine and so are other Ben and jerry flavours but we are cursious if this is due to the soft middle.\n",
            "I love this flavor when I was able to find it I’m my local Walmart super Center but now I am not able to find it there. Your product locator just confirmed to me that it could not find it in my area . Please bring it back to Elkins,WV Walmart super Center.\n",
            "Not a huge fan of the new fudge chips on the caramel side. It was my favorite flavor before this addition. I enjoyed having one side of the icecream that was perfectly creamy with the chunks remaining on the chocolate side. Not nearly as good now.\n",
            "Karamel Sutra is SO delish! The texture & flavor are unmatched and the smooth rich caramel core is such a WONDERFUL surprise to your taste buds. Superior quality and dedication to the best ice cream ever! My all-time favorite. Kudos Ben & Jerry!\n",
            "I'm always looking for this flavor in store but when I find it...OH YES! This is my favorite flavor. From the caramel icecream to the core to the chocolate icecream and back....loveeeeeeee\n",
            "I cannot let this flavor have anything less than 5 stars. This is my all time favorite Ben & Jerry's! The center caramel is perfection. I like to save as much of it as I can till the end!\n",
            "I have been eating Karamel sutra ice cream when the grocery I shop at put it on the freezer shelf. If it was available by the gallon, I would buy at least 3 at a time.\n",
            "My nr 1 fave that is avaivable in Sweden! I have noticed that the core doesn't go all the way to the bottom :( And I WISH it was vegan </3 but overall SOSOSOSO GOOD!\n",
            "I used to buy this regularly at the Giant Eagle stores in Ohio. I've not seen it in stock lately. I'm hoping the flavor doesn't drop into the graveyard.\n",
            "Disappointed that the Karamel Core was only a third of the way down the center of the pint. I expected it to be all the way through to the bottom.\n",
            "Love it!!!!! One of my favorites. Awesome blend of ice cream, chocolate and caramel. Just wish the caramel core went all the way through.\n",
            "It's the best ice cream ever! Karamel Sutra has the best texture and flavor. The perfect amount of chocolate and I love the caramel core.\n",
            "Love it..... Personally I love the Caramel Core but it's very hard to find this flavor I don't know why rite aid don't have this flavor.\n",
            "This ice cream is absolutely delicious, the best part is the caramel core. Unfortunately the core doesn’t go all the way to the bottom.\n",
            "A soft caramel core flowing between caramel ice cream and rich chocolate ice cream. The dark chocolate fudge chips are sublime.\n",
            "First I was in love with New York super fudge chunk but then I got a taste for this Karamel Jar of 7th heaven and I was sold!\n",
            "This is my favorite. Many of these new ones are terrible! I can't stand the Jimmy Fallon pints at al to name a couple.\n",
            "One of my favorite combos !!! Creamy and caramelly !!! Love!! S/o to BNJ for standing up for racial issues too !!\n",
            "I've been eating this ice cream for about a year now. It is simply wonderful. I really love the caramel core.\n",
            "It's a Ben and Jerry's creation, so it's automaticly tasty, but nothing about it made me want to try it again\n",
            "My go to, EVERYTIME. You can really tell the quality of ingredients in this pint by its superb taste. Bravo!\n",
            "Love caramel and this just brought it over the edge, absolutely in love with this!!! Simple but amazing :)\n",
            "I may buy other flavors but not without including this one in the mix. Caramel and chocolate, enough said\n",
            "One of the best ice cream flavors ever made! Once you start eating it, it's almost impossible to stop!\n",
            "If you love caramel, you will love this combination. I would love more caramel in the core. YUM!\n",
            "This is the best ice cream ever. I love eating around the core until that's all that's left.\n",
            "I can’t get enough of this flavor! My only issue is that it’s rarely available in my area.\n",
            "This is by far the best Ice Cream I ever had! And the tast and consistency is outstanding\n",
            "By far my favorite one!!! Just have a hard time finding it in the stores around me!!!\n",
            "Amazing amazing. Only prob was core didn't go to the bottom. It's the best part. Sad.\n",
            "If I believed Ice Cream could be sinful.\n",
            ".this one is so decadent, it might qualify!\n",
            "This is the best flavor of the family I hope it never goes to the flavor graveyard\n",
            "This ice cream *literally* saves my life every time I eat it. The best. Period.\n",
            "loved it! could have had more caramel through the ice cream but still amazing\n",
            "You can’t go wrong with this delicious treat! This is my all time favorite.\n",
            "Just downright yummy & delicious. One can eat the whole pint in one setting\n",
            "The absolutely best flavor combination. The dark chocolate is sublime.\n",
            "This is my favorite Ben & Jerry’s flavor!! Please never get rid of it\n",
            "My favorite ice cream only had a caramel core barely halfway down :(\n",
            "I would truly die without it. it’s the only ice cream I care about.\n",
            "This is hands down my favorite flavor! So delicious and decadent\n",
            "Have loved it for awhile now. But can’t seem to find it anymore.\n",
            "I always buy this ice cream whenever I go to the grocery store!\n",
            "I love this one so much that I buy it when it’s not on sale.\n",
            "This flavor has been one of my favorites for over 9 years!\n",
            "It’s good. That’s it. Just GOOOOOD!! Every single time!\n",
            "It's great. Caramel core is the best part. I love it.\n",
            "This is by far one of the best Ben & Jerry's flavor ever created. I found this flavor in my supermarket a few weeks ago & being a chocoholic peanut butter fanatic I had to try it. A delightful swirl of ice creams,a rich chocolately and creamy peanut butter core , and tons of chocolate peanut butter cups!!! Keep up the good work Ben & Jerry's!!!\n",
            "It's hard to even find the words to describe how much I LOVE this ice cream. If ever it gets sent to the graveyard, I am not sure I would want to continue existing on such a cruel planet. Please, please, please never get rid of PEANUT BUTTER FUDGE CORE!\n",
            "I have been buying this guy over and over. My freezer is always stocked with this flavor. The only bad thing Ihave to say is that not all contents of containers are created alike. Some have a lot of pb cups and some others lack those mini peanut butter cups that I love so much. I wish for more pb cups and less fudge core. Otherwise this is perfection\n",
            "I’m not a huge ice cream eater EXCEPT for this one! The PB Fudge Core strikes the perfect balance of both the peanut butter and chocolate to create a heavenly pint of pure yumminess.\n",
            "My only complaint is that it is getting harder to find! It has been unseated by more weak-kneed, lower calorie, younger siblings. They can only DREAM of being this good.\n",
            "I just crushed my first pint of this one and WOW, I may have a new favorite flavor! Everything is amazing from the ice cream flavors to the mini cups and the core. It’s really a triumph of Ben And Jerry’s research and development, truth be told! Buy this, eat it and be happy!\n",
            "I bought the Peanut Butter Fudge Core yesterday and the moment the ice cream touched my tongue I was in heaven. This ice cream is now one of my favorite ice creams ever!! Thank you for creating this ice cream.\n",
            "I eat ice cream for the yummy things that are in it (pieces of peanutbutter cups in this case) unfortunately I might have had in total 1 whole peanutbutter in the entire pint. Very disappointed as I love peanutbutter cups but with so very little in it I don't think I'll be getting this one again.\n",
            "I have bought this 3 times now, so you could say I'm a fan. I love the two different ice-cream flavors, but the core tastes fake and processed to me. I was hoping that maybe I just got a bad batch but now that my third one tastes the same I think this is the real flavor. Re-invent the core flavor and this would be a 5-star.\n",
            "I bought this today after trying the cookie dough core pint which was highly disappointing. This one is 1000 times better and my new flavor. Two things I would change- more pb cups because when are there too many pb cups?? And the core didn't go all the way down\n",
            "I wasn't expecting something this satisfying, it's perfectly balanced and no peanut butter cup will ever be worth it ever again, this ice cream has ruined me for any other brand.\n",
            "I love this ice cream!! Anytime I need something sweet I grab a pint of peanut butter fudge core, Plz dont ever stop making this flavor!!!\n",
            "I could die for this flavor. The peanut butter fudge core is so amazing I could eat theee pints in a day.\n",
            "This is my favorite ice cream flavor -- if this is in the store, I will never walk out with another flavor. If they don't have it, sometimes I'll walk another block to check another store or two. It's that good. Great balance, so it feels very rich instead and never too sweet. Both sides of the ice cream are equally compelling, so there are no disappointing bites. I hope this flavor sticks around for a long long time.\n",
            "I can eat peanut butter, but I'm not a huge fan. In the store one day, they were out of my favorite (Half Baked). One of the few remaining flavors on the shelf, I bought the Peanut Butter Fudge Core. This stuff is so addictive, and I just can't get enough. I love the fudge core, and I love the tiny peanut butter cups. It's a perfect blend of flavors and textures. Beyond YUM!\n",
            "Oh man I use to be a whatever was on sale girl but my now fiance brand me this ice cream when I wasn't feeling good and it quickly became my favorite. It's is the perfect combination. It hit the spot when you get the craving. I am always in the look out. I since tried other flavor. I'm found of fish food but this is delicious....please sell more shoprite in linden NJ lol\n",
            "This is the first chocolate ice cream I’ve tried and actually liked. The peanut butter cups and the combination of all the flavors along with the smooth core texture makes for a dreamy ice cream!\n",
            "This is the best pint of ice cream I've ever had!! If you like chocolate or peanut butter or ice cream or have any taste at all you'll love this flavor!!!!\n",
            "This is my favorite ice cream ever! Can't get any better than that. Everyone who loves chocolate/peanut butter combination should try it.\n",
            "This is my favorite flavor...I can just buy one!! Highly recommend\n"
